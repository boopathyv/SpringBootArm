","The physicist will recognize this view of language as having something in common with Information Theory, in which 'bits' of information are transported via a channel from transmitter to receiver. A related notion has also entered physics in the concept of a 'signal', which occupies a key position in the Special Theory of Relativity. Bohm, however, has pointed out that Einstein's conception of a signal does not cohere with the corresponding 'quantum' context of physics, for it implies 'a certain kind of analysis which is not compatible with the sort of undivided wholeness that is implied by the quantum theory'.\nWe call this 'transport view of language' into question. The writings of Bohr and Bohm have made it clear that, in the evolution of scientific thought, language is playing a more active role than is implied by a passive vehicle which merely conveys information. In the context of communication theory, linguists themselves have also pointed to the inadequacies of this traditional viewpoint, for it is clear that the listener is as active as the speaker in elaborating the content of the message.

",c,"Mind does all human mental functions which are physiological processes","Scientifically, human consciousness, knowing, perception, reasoning, intellectual abilities, understanding, experience etc., are mental processes of the vertebrate human-being, belonging to Homo sapiens species. Thus human mental processes are biological, involving physicochemical energy transitions and transformations relating to brain, spinal cord and the nervous system (Guyton and Hall, 2004), Blakemore, 1977). Mind, which is an expression and part of consciousness, is an aspect of human body. Mind does all human mental functions which are physiological processes. Thus psychology is physiology. Consciousness and mind are aspects of body.\nAs visualized by some, consciousness is the collection of millions of neurons and their electrochemical states, even if we have no real knowledge of chemical nature of thoughts and ideas. According to them, we neither have understood completely how living organisms originated and evolved. They feel that we may not be able to define precisely what life is nor whence it came from.

,5,"The passage conveys the following message EXCEPT ","Anti- oxidants  save cells from being damaged by free radicals.","Endogenous anti-oxidants work in the same way as exogenous anti-oxidants do. ","The level of enzymatic reaction in the body is dependant on how high the oxidative stress is.","Anti-oxidants are absorbable enzymes associated with the protecting mechanism of human body. ",b,This statement is beyond the passage and not discussed at all. ,"An Anti-oxidant is a molecule capable of inhibiting the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electron from a sunstance to an oxidizing agent. Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals. In turn, these radicals can start chain reactions. When the chain reaction occurs in a cell, it can cause damage or death to the cell, Anti-oxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates and inhibit other oxidation reactions. They do this by oxidized themselves. So anti-oxidants are often reducing agents such as thios, ascorbic acid or polyphenols. \nThe body produces different anti-oxidants to neutralize free radicals & protect the body from different diseases. Exogenous anti-oxidants are externally supplied to the body through food and they also play important role to protect the body. Endogeneous anti-oxidant defence system developed by the body can be classified into two groups- enzymatic & non-enzymatic. The enzymatic defence system includes different  endogeneous enzymes like Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glutathione reductase (GR). MDA is oxidative stress marker in the body which increases on increase in oxidative stress. Non-enzymatic defence system includes Vit.E, Vit.C  and reduced Glutathione (GSH).",,

Before elaborating on these observations, it is necessary to point out that the term community participation is amenable to be used in two senses : a strict sense and a liberal sense. In the strict sense of the term, it signifies a community's engagement with its development project in all the phases including planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. In a liberal sense, it is also used for the engagement of self-help groups as well as social action groups in their respective development projects. ",,

They are also engaged in producing and selling a variety of goods such as vegetables, fruits, flowers, cooked food, groceries etc. Empowerment of women involves many things, economic opportunity, property rights, political representation, social equality, personal rights and so on. Historically, the world over, either by law or by custom, the status of women is undermined by asymmetrical power relationships in decision-making, personal and social rights, access to resources and entitlement. Women in many countries still lack rights to inherit property, own land, get education, obtain credit, earn income or work outside home, control their fertility: they are still widely under-represented in involvement in decision-making at the household or social level.

Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men; which both in affection and means, have married and endowed the public. Yet it were great reason that those that have children, should have greatest care of future times; unto which they know they must transmit their dearest pledges. Some there are, who though they lead a single life, yet their thoughts do end with themselves, and account future times impertinences. Nay, there are some other, that account wife and children, but as bills of charges. Nay more, there are some foolish rich covetous men that take a pride, in having no children, because they may be thought so much the richer. For perhaps they have heard some talk, Such an one is a great rich man, and another except to it, Yea, but he hath a great charge of children; as if it were an abatement to his riches. But the most ordinary cause of a single life, is liberty, especially in certain self-pleasing and humorous minds, which are so sensible of every restraint, as they will go near to think their girdles and garters, to be bonds and shackles. Unmarried men are best friends, best masters, best servants; but not always best subjects; for they are light to run away; and almost all fugitives, are of that condition. A single life doth well with churchmen; for charity will hardly water the ground, where it must first fill a pool. It is indifferent for judges and magistrates; for if they be facile and corrupt, you shall have a servant, five times worse than a wife. For soldiers, I find the generals commonly in their hortatives, put men in mind of their wives and children; and I think the despising of marriage amongst the Turks, maketh the vulgar soldier more base. Certainly wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity; and single men, though they may be many times more charitable, because their means are less exhaust, yet, on the other side, they are more cruel and hardhearted (good to make severe inquisitors), because their tenderness is not so oft called upon. Grave natures, led by custom, and therefore constant, are commonly loving husbands, as was said of Ulysses, vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati. Chaste women are often proud and froward, as presuming upon the merit of their chastity. It is one of the best bonds, both of chastity and obedience, in the wife, if she think her husband wise; which she will never do, if she find him jealous. Wives are young men's mistresses; companions for middle age; and old men's nurses. So as a man may have a quarrel to marry, when he will. But yet he was reputed one of the wise men, that made answer to the question, when a man should marry,- A young man not yet, an elder man not at all. It is often seen that bad husbands, have very good wives; whether it be, that it raises the price of their husband's kindness, when it comes; or that the wives take a pride in their patience. But this never fails, if the bad husbands were of their own choosing, against their friends' consent; for then they will be sure to make good their own folly.",,

","To explain the growth in the world economy which has turned out be unfavorable to the revival of import policies that India is likely to carry out to increase the expectation of the foreign investors over choosing India as an investing hub.","To deliberate on the precise cause which has triggered the dramatic fall in rupee and that is misconceived because of the resurgence in the economy of the USA. ","To highlight that though the government and the RBI have tried to patch up the fall in rupee by narrowly understanding its cause and reacting simply to the resurgence in the economy of the USA, they have failed to alter the fiscal policy that has capped on the expecting investments, which would have otherwise averted the recurrent fall in rupee. ","To clarify that the fall in Indian rupee is not the result of the immediate change in the global financial market, being sensitive to which the government has taken impertinent measures, but unwelcoming situation in India to invest and long term economic and fiscal policies that are not overhauled, while analyzing the regression in economy.",c,"The entire passage is about how the government wrongly perceived the reality and took incorrect measures to control the fall of the rupee. ","After unleashing some rather unpopular weapons of yore on the markets over the last month and a half, the Reserve Bank of India and the government find themselves in an unenviable situation. The very measures that were meant to protect the rupee have turned toxic and boomeranged. Both the rupee and the stock market indices continue their nosedive. The increase in short-term rates aimed at draining liquidity failed to contain the falling rupee. Since July 15, when the measures were announced, the currency has depreciated 5.40 per cent, falling from Rs.59.89 to Rs.63.13 to the dollar, cocking a snook at the RBI. What the measure did though was to alienate corporate India further by impacting sentiment and raising fears of a rebound in medium and long-term rates. Indeed, some banks have already announced an increase in their base lending rate, signifying the rising cost of funds. Axis Bank raised its base rate by 0.25 percentage points to 10.25 per cent on Monday. The damage could still have been contained if the central bank had stopped there. But the urge, and probably pressure on it, to control the rupee’s slide was so high that came out with the next move that really stunned the markets: the restriction on investment outflows on corporate and individuals. That measure to control capital outflow ironically had the opposite effect as foreign investors panicked and voted with their feet. In the world of financial markets, perceptions matter as much, if not more than reality and the central bank’s measures were perceived as the return of capital controls. The result is the ongoing mayhem in the stock market with the Sensex losing a whopping 5.46 per cent or 1,059 points in just two trading sessions on Friday and Monday. The rupee had its worst day in more than a decade, falling by Rs.1.48 to an all-time low of Rs.63.13.\nThe question that rises now is: did the RBI and government press the panic button much too soon? Hindsight is always 20:20 and it is easy to comment on the RBI’s actions, especially when you don’t have access to the information and data that prompted its actions. Yet, one needs to ask if the measures, especially the second set announced on the eve of Independence Day, were called for. Of course, to be fair to the central bank, it can only do what is within its powers and that is using monetary policy tools; these cannot substitute for resolute action from the fiscal side, which is the government’s prerogative. Indeed, the comments of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday at a RBI function couldn’t have been more apt. Dr. Singh spoke of the 'possibilities and limitations of monetary policy in a globalised, fiscally constrained economy.' He may or may not have meant it as a dig at the central bank but the truth unfortunately is that there are indeed limits to what monetary policy can achieve in the absence of support from fiscal policy. The root cause for the problems with the rupee and the current account deficit (CAD) are not so much to do with monetary policy as with prolonged neglect of the real sector of the economy. The truth is the UPA II government has failed to create a conducive environment for investment in manufacturing. Even as inflation was raging, all the action to control it was on the demand side and not on the supply side, where the problems were.\nProjects were held up for want of clearances related to land and environment even as power supply and other infrastructure constraints posed problems for those that were already operational. Exports fell for want of sympathetic policy measures such as interest subvention schemes to protect units in the medium and small-scale sector from high interest rates. Just imagine the dividends that a competitive exports sector could have brought in these times of a depreciating rupee. A small example of what could have been is provided by the apparel segment whose exports grew by 12 per cent in June to $1.24 billion and by 11 per cent to $3.56 billion in the first quarter of this fiscal, according to the Apparel Export Promotion Council.\nThere are also other important factors for the high current account deficit such as the inability to arrest fuel subsidies, which meant that consumption growth continued unabated and hence oil imports continued to grow. Had the government even turned a small part of its focus on gold import to fuel subsidies, the import bill could have been lower. There could also have been better appreciation of the fact that the falling trend in the rupee was also because of global capital returning to the U.S. in anticipation of improved economic prospects there. Capital, like water, finds its level and that level is where returns are best. The only way to combat such an outflow is to create conditions within India that will improve the prospects of returns. As any economist would tell you, it is futile to hold back or even be seen to be holding back capital against its will, especially in a world free of controls.\nThus, the basic mistake that policymakers made was misreading the symptom as the disease. The falling rupee and rising CAD are just symptoms of the illness which is the sustained fall in manufacturing growth in recent years and the consequent loss of investment opportunities for both FDI and FII investors, on the one hand and the resurgence in the U.S. economy, on the other. And the cure for both is the same: encourage the manufacturing sector by removing hurdles to investment and production. That will, in due course, get the rupee the respect it deserves.",,
