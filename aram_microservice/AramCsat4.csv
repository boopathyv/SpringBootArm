He has developed a computer program that deconstructs works of art into sets of numbers. Now Ribeiro has applied his physics-inspired metrics to nearly 140,000 digitized paintings indexed on the visual art encyclopedia WikiArt to look for trends in the evolution of painting styles.\nThe process, described by Ribeiro and his colleagues last September in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, involves assessing the complexity and entropy, or disorder, of these digitized artworks. Complexity is based on the variability of patterns within each image, ranging from highly variable (more complex) to uniform (less complex). Entropy is determined by the degree of chaos in the image; the more 'regular' the painting, the lower the entropy. The new algorithm analyzes two-by-two grids of pixels within each painting and scores them using the two metrics. Ribeiro and his colleagues observed that shifts in the magnitude of complexity and entropy among various paintings mirror stylistic shifts throughout art history. Modern art—with blended edges and loose brushstrokes—generally possesses low complexity and high entropy. Postmodern art, a simpler style with recognizable objects and stark, well-defined edges (for example, Andy Warhol’s soup cans), has high complexity and low entropy. In the late 1960s there was a rapid shift from modern to postmodern art; the algorithm is able to quantify the extremity of this shift. These simple metrics could be used to better understand how art has evolved, capture information about various artistic periods and determine how these periods interacted, the researchers say. By learning from these patterns, the program could even be used to sort lesser-known works of art into specific artistic styles. Maximilian Schich, a professor of arts and technology at University of Texas at Dallas, is in favor of the cross-disciplinary research. 'One thing I think is very elegant in this paper is that they look at the complexity at the local level, the pixels and the surrounding pixels,' Schich says. 'You could say, ‘Yeah, that’s too simple—it doesn’t explain all of the painting.’ But it’s research that is valuable.'",,

Literature is the expression of individual and social life and thought through language. While the subject matter and treatment must be such as are of general human interest, the expression must be emotive; the form must give aesthetic pleasure and satisfaction.\nLiterature must not be confounded with sociology, philosophy, religion or psychology, though these give substance and depth to literature. It may or may not impart knowledge or religious or moral instruction directly. Its theme may be social problem or political revolution or religious movement; but it may, with equal justification, be an individual's passion, problem or fantasy. But the object is not so much to teach as to delight.\nBooks are literature when they bring us into some relation with real life. Herein lies its power and universal appeal. While there are some who take perfection of form to be the chief pre-occupation of literature, many more are inclined to the view that the primary value of literature is its human significance.

On the one hand, they make generalizations about politics and people in order to gain a broader understanding. On the other hand, political scientists do not want to rely on, or perpetuate, stereotypes. Finding a balance between these two is difficult. Scholars must carefully examine their use of language and data in an attempt to avoid stereotyping. Political culture changes over time, but these changes often happen slowly. People frequently become set in their ways and refuse to alter their attitudes on significant issues. Sometimes it can take generations for major shifts to occur in a nation’s political culture.\nOne example of the ways in which American political culture has been slow to change concerns the rights of minorities. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 authorized federal troops to supervise balloting in federal elections in the South in order to protect the voting rights of black Americans. Even though the bill passed forty years ago, many government officials fear that racial tensions in the South could still threaten the political freedoms of blacks, which is why Congress and President George W.
