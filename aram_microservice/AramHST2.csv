,12,"3. Consider the following statements regarding Igneous rocks:\n1. They are known as primary rocks.\n2. They contain abundant Fossils..\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,A ,"What are igneous rocks?\n• Igneous rocks (from the Greek word for fire) form from when hot, molten rock crystallizes and solidifies. The melt originates deep within the Earth near active plate boundaries or hot spots, then rises toward the surface. Igneous rocks are divided into two groups, intrusive or extrusive, depending upon where the molten rock solidifies.\nIntrusive Igneous Rocks:\n• Intrusive, or plutonic, igneous rock forms when magma is trapped deep inside the Earth. Great globs of molten rock rise toward the surface. Some of the magma may feed volcanoes on the Earth's surface, but most remains trapped below, where it cools very slowly over many thousands or millions of years until it solidifies. Slow cooling means the individual mineral grains have a very long time to grow, so they grow to a relatively large size. Intrusive rocks have a coarse grained texture.\nExtrusive Igneous Rocks:\n• Extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rock is produced when magma exits and cools above (or very near) the Earth's surface. These are the rocks that form at erupting volcanoes and oozing fissures. The magma, called lava when molten rock erupts on the surface, cools and solidifies almost instantly when it is exposed to the relatively cool temperature of the atmosphere. Quick cooling means that mineral crystals don't have much time to grow, so these rocks have a very fine-grained or even glassy texture. Hot gas bubbles are often trapped in the quenched lava, forming a bubbly, vesicular texture.",,,
,12,"4. Which of the following factors help in formation of fold mountains?\n1. Increased load of overlying rocks.\n2. Flow movements in the mantle.\n3. Magmatic intrusion into the crust.\nSelect the correct answer using the codes given below",1 only,1 and 3 only,2 and 3 only,"1, 2 and 3",D,"• Fold mountains are created where two or more of Earth’s tectonic plates are pushed together. At these colliding, compressing boundaries, rocks and debris are warped and folded into rocky outcrops, hills, mountains, and entire mountain ranges.\n• Fold mountains are created through a process called orogeny. An orogenic event takes millions of years to create a fold mountain, but you can mimic it in seconds. Cover a table with a tablecloth, or place a rug flat on the floor. Now push the edge of the tablecloth or rug—wrinkles will develop and fold on top of each other.\n• The vocabulary of fold mountains owes something to this simple tablecloth experiment. Some of the key structures in fold mountains are nappes. Nappes are common, dramatic folded rocks or rock formations. 'Nappe' is French for 'tablecloth' and the formations were named after the tabletop experiment.\n•  The huge difference between the rock folds and cloth folds is that in the tabletop experiment, the table itself does not fold. In the creation of fold mountains, Earth’s crust itself is warped into folded forms.\n•  Fold mountains are often associated with continental crust. They are created at convergent plate boundaries, sometimes called continental collision zones or compression zones. Convergent plate boundaries are sites of collisions, where tectonic plates crash into each other. Compression describes a set of stresses directed at one point in a rock or rock formation.\n• At a compression zone, tectonic activity forces crustal compression at the leading edge of the crust formation. For this reason, most fold mountains are found on the edge or former edge of continental plate boundaries. Rocks on the edge of continental crust are often weaker and less stable than rocks found in the continental interior. This makes them more susceptible to folding and warping. Most fold mountains are composed of sedimentary rock and metamorphic rock formed under high pressure and relatively low temperatures. Many fold mountains are also formed where an underlying layer of ductile minerals, such as salt, is present.\n Young and Old, High and Low\n•  Fold mountains are the most common type of mountain in the world. The rugged, soaring heights of the Himalayas, Andes, and Alps are all active fold mountains.\n• The Himalayas stretch through the borders of China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and Pakistan. The crust beneath the Himalaya, the most towering mountain range on Earth, is still the process of being compressed. Here, the Indian plate is colliding northward with the Eurasian plate. The sedimentary rocks of the Himalayas include shale and limestone. Metamorphic rocks of the region include schist and gneiss. Dikes of igneous rock also intrude throughout the rock formations of the Himalayas.\n• The Andes are the world’s longest mountain chain. They stretch along the entire west coast of South America, from Colombia in the north and through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina to the south. Here, the dense oceanic crust of the Nazca and Antarctic plates is subducting beneath the less-dense continental crust of the South American plate. The Andes are mostly being folded and uplifted from the thicker, less-dense rocks of the South American plate. The sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of the Andes are dotted by active and dormant volcanoes.\n• The Alps roughly mark the top of the 'boot' of the Italian Peninsula. The Alps stretch across Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Monaco, and France. Here, the tiny Adriatic plate is colliding with the much larger Eurasian plate to the north. The J-shaped Adriatic plate is a remnant of the African plate to the south, and today it carries the eastern Italian Peninsula as well as the entire Adriatic Sea. Alpine geology includes sedimentary and metamorphic rock, as well as igneous rocks that once were part of the ocean floor and were later uplifted in the process of folding.\n• Not all fold mountains are soaring peaks. The Appalachians, stretching along North America’s east coast, are generally low-lying, gentle slopes. Millions of years ago, the Appalachians were taller than the Himalayas! Millions of years of erosion, however, have taken their toll. Today, some of the highest peaks of the Appalachians are less than a third of the height of Everest.\n•  The crust that is now the Appalachians began folding 480 million years ago, when the North American and African continental plates collided. Plate tectonics created this ancient mountain range, then called the Central Pangean Mountains . . . and plate tectonics tore it apart. As tectonic activity ripped apart the ancient supercontinent Pangea, the African, Eurasian, and North American plates drifted apart.\n•  The Appalachians are just one remnant of the Central Pangean Mountains. The Appalachians stretch from the province of Newfoundland, in southeastern Canada, through the southern state of Alabama in the U.S. They are related to the gentle fold mountains of the Scottish Highlands (Eurasia) and the Little Atlas Mountains, Morocco (Africa)—their orogenic sisters from the Central Pangean Mountains.\nTypes of Folds\n• Fold mountains are defined by complex, vital geologic forms known as folds. There are many, many different types of folds. Geologists primarily categorize folds by their shape—do they have sharp turns or gentle curves? Are the folds convex or concave?\n• A fold mountain usually displays more than one type of fold. Anticlines and synclines are the most common up-and-down folds that result from compression. An anticline has a ∩-shape, with the oldest rocks in the center of the fold. A syncline is a U-shape, with the youngest rocks in the center of the fold.\n•  Domes and basins are often considered types of folds. A dome is a series of symmetrical anticlines, roughly shaped like half a sphere. Like an anticline, the oldest rocks in a dome are found in the center. A basin is a depression, or dip, in the Earth’s surface. Like a syncline, a basin has its youngest rocks in its center.\nOther types of fold include:\n• monoclines. A monocline is a type of fold in which all rock layers incline, or dip, in the same direction.\n• chevron. A chevron is a sharp, straight fold where rock layers look like zig-zags.\n• slump. A slump fold is a result of slope failure (a type of mass wasting or landslide). The slope failure happened when sediments were soft, before they became a single mass of rock. As the sediments lithified, they became a slump.\n• ptygmatic. Ptygmatic folds are a type of slump fold created where the folding material is much more viscous than the material surrounding it. Many ptygmatic folds are created as metamorphic rock melts and intrudes into another rock layer, forming a dike.\n• disharmonic. Disharmonic folds describe rock formations in which different rock layers have different fold shapes.",,,
,12,"Consider the following pairs:\n1. Geysers and hot springs – Emission of water vapors\n2. Fumaroles – Emission of gases like CO2, SO2.\nWhich of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?",1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,C,"• Hot springs and geysers also are manifestations of volcanic activity. They result from the interaction of groundwater with magma or with solidified but still-hot igneous rocks at shallow depths.\n• Yellowstone National Park in the United States is one of the most famous areas of hot springs and geysers in the world. The total heat flux from these thermal features is estimated to be 300 megawatts (300 million watts). The last great eruption at Yellowstone occurred about 630,000 years ago when some 1,000 cubic km (240 cubic miles) of rhyoliticpumice and ash were ejected in huge pyroclastic flows and resulted in the formation of a caldera—a large circular or oval depression caused by collapse of the surface following magma removal—approximately 45 by 75 km (28 by 47 miles) in size. Yellowstone Lake now occupies part of this giant caldera. Since that last great outburst, about 1,200 cubic km (288 cubic miles) of rhyolite lava flows and domes have erupted in numerous smaller events. The cooling roots of such past eruptions, or possibly the new intrusions of magma at shallow depth, are the heat sources for the Yellowstone hot springs and geysers.\n• Geysers are hot springs that intermittently spout a column of hot water and steam into the air. This action is caused by the water in deep conduits beneath a geyser approaching or reaching the boiling point. At 300 metres (about 1,000 feet) below the surface, the boiling point of water increases to approximately 230 °C (450 °F) because of the increased pressure of the overlying water. As bubbles of steam or dissolved gas begin to form, rise, and expand, hot water spills from the geyser’s vent, lowering the pressure on the water column below. Water at depth then momentarily exceeds its boiling point and flashes into steam, forcing additional water from the vent. This chain reactioncontinues until the geyser exhausts its supply of boiling water.\n• Cross section of a geyser and hot springGroundwater percolates through porous rock into fractures deep underground, where heat from a nearby magma chamber superheats the pressurized water to a temperature above the boiling point of water at surface pressure. In hot springs the rising superheated water is cooled below the boiling point by groundwater before reaching the surface. In geysers the superheated water collects in underground pockets. There a small drop in pressure caused by the release of water at the surface flashes the superheated water into steam, which expands and ejects a column of steam and water into the air. When the supply of steam and hot water is exhausted, the spouting stops and the cycle begins again.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\n• After a geyser stops spouting, the conduits at depth refill with groundwater, and reheating begins again. In geysers such as Yellowstone’s Old Faithful, the spouting and recharge period is quite regular. This famous geyser has gushed to heights of 30 to 55 metres (100 to 180 feet) about every 90 minutes for more than 100 years. If Old Faithful’s eruption lasts only a minute or two, the next interval will be shorter than average, while a four-minute eruption will be followed by a longer interval. Other geysers have much more erratic recharge times.",,,

Weathering is the breaking down of rock into smaller components by atmospheric and biotic action agencies.\n2. Mass wasting involves the relatively short-distance down slope movement of broken rock material under the direct influence of gravity.\n3.

,12,The transport route connecting the Kashmir from Leh crosses the high mountain ranges at the:,Pir Panjal pass ,Karakoram pass ,Banihal pass ,Zoji La pass,B,"•  The Karakoram Pass is a hill pass in the middle of India and China, lying in the Karakoram Mountain Range . It is the tallest pass on the very old caravan path in the midst of Leh in Ladakh and Yarkand in the Tarim Valley. In Turkey, the expression Karakoram refers to 'Black Gravel'. The Karakoram Pass rises to an elevation of 5,540 m (18,176 ft).\nAbout Karakoram Pass\n• The towering altitude and deficiency of foodgrains were the principal causes for the losses of numerous pack animals. The course through the pass was disreputable for the trace of bones sprinkled adjacent to the itinerary. There is virtually no presence of flora on the entry routes to the pass. The southern segment of the pass is more barren than the north. Traversing the lower Suget Dawan or Suget Pass is easier.\n• The Karakoram Pass is in a seat in the middle of two mountains. The width of the pass is approximately 45 meters (148 ft). There is no plant life or icecap and it is typically bereft of snow as a result of the breezes. There are moderate temperatures, recurrently powerful breezes, snowstorms are a common feature, and the towering altitude has an outcome. Irrespective of all these factors, the Karakoram Pass was assumed to be a fairly trouble-free pass as a consequence of the stable upward slope on both sides. There was deficiency of summer frost and snow for the maximum portion of the year. Therefore, the pass remained open for the maximum part of the year. However, there is no passable path over the pass, and the pass at the moment is kept shut to all types of traffic movements\nCold breezes move at a terrific speed in this area.\n• The Karakoram Pass moves through the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir . It is situated on one of the tallest business and commerce itineraries in the world for Yarkand, located in Central Asia. The itinerary takes you from the Nubra Basin in Ladakh above the Siser La, Tulimpati La, and above the camp locations such as Burtso, Murgo, Daulatbeg Oldi, Kazilangar, and ultimately guides you to the pass.\n• The area around the pass is infertile with no foliage at all. Temperatures can decline to minus 30°C and snowstorms are a regular feature round the year. If you come close to the Daultat Beg Oldi Camp Location, you will find an extensive stretch of 16 km beside the desiccated embankment of the river. You will never fail to notice the itinerary if you go by the trace of the bare bones of various creatures and human beings. These are soundless prompts of the inhospitable circumstances that resulted in casualties in ancient periods when this itinerary was utilized by merchants of Central Asia.\n• The final extension of the pass culminates towards the right of the embankment of the river to the pass. In spite of the fact that the slope is moderate and not especially hard, it is the low density (low oxygen content) air that makes going past this pass especially difficult. At the place where the pass culminates, there is an ascent of approximately 1,000 feet and in the remoteness, a groove is seen, which is nothing else but the Karakoram Pass. \n• The coordinates of the pass are 35°30′48″N and 77°49′23″E.\n• At an elevation of 18,176 ft, the pass is created by a seat amid two moderately high mountain peaks. The width is just 50 yards. On the opposite slope, there is a stable decline, infertile and moderate mountain aspects are present between the elevations of 19,000 feet and 20,000 feet.\n• One part of this enormous Himalayan strip is located in India and another part is situated in China.\nGeopolitical matters\n• The Karakoram Pass is situated on the border of areas under the dominance of India (the territory of Jammu and Kashmir) and China (Xinxiang Autonomous Territory).\n• The Karakoram Pass also plays a significant geological role in the disagreement between India and Pakistan about the dominance of Siachen Glacier Region right away towards the west of the Pass.\n• These circumstances occurred after the Simla Agreement, which was ratified in 1972 between Pakistan and India, when the pact was unsuccessful to delineate the final 60 miles (100 km) or so of the armistice line from the finish of the Line of Control to the boundary with China.\n• A probable India-China-Pakistan tripoint at Karakoram Pass is mentioned in a border pact between Pakistan and China in 1963. This was in relation to the Trans-Karakoram territory, however India was not aware of that accord nor any tripoint contract. The presently existing tripoint is approximately 100 km west to the pass at Indira Col in the Siachen Muztagh. This is the spot where the Actual Ground Position Line between Pakistani and Indian Army touches the boundary with China.",,,

Biological deserts occur in both continents and oceans\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,C,"• The oceans biological desert is expanding greatly in last few centuries. \n• Biological desert is nothing but regions having very low biomass.\n• Desert, any large, extremely dry area of land with sparse vegetation. It is one of Earth’s major types of ecosystems, supporting a community of distinctive plants and animals specially adapted to the harsh environment.\n• Desert environments are so dry that they support only extremely sparse vegetation; trees are usually absent and, under normal climatic conditions, shrubs or herbaceous plants provide only very incomplete ground cover. Extreme aridity renders some deserts virtually devoid of plants; however, this barrenness is believed to be due in part to the effects of human disturbance, such as heavy grazing of cattle, on an already stressed environment.\n• According to some definitions, any environment that is almost completely free of plants is considered desert, including regions too cold to support vegetation—i.e., 'frigid deserts.' Other definitions use the term to apply only to hot and temperate deserts, a restriction followed in this account.\n• The Sahara, the Gobi, the Chihuahuan--all are great deserts. But what about the South Pacific's subtropical gyre? This ""biological desert"" within a swirling expanse of nutrient-starved saltwater is the largest, and least productive, ecosystem of the South Pacific. Together with the subtropical gyres in other oceans, biological deserts cover 40% of Earth's surface. But their relative obscurity may be about to change. Researchers are reporting that the ocean's biological deserts have been expanding, and they are growing much faster than global warming models predict.",,,

Lagoons are formed in flood plains of river and in coasts.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,A,"A lagoon is a body of water separated from larger bodies of water by a natural barrier.\nLagoons are separated from larger bodies of water by sandbars, barrier reefs, coral reefs, or other natural barriers. The word 'lagoon' derives from the Italian word laguna, which means 'pond' or 'lake'.\nAlthough lagoons are well defined geographically, the word 'lagoon' is sometimes used as a name for a larger region that contains one or more lagoons. For example, Laguna Madre on the Texas Gulf Coast is actually made up of smaller bays and lagoons, while Laguna Beach in Southern California is actually a beach and not a lagoon at all.\nThere are two types of lagoons: atoll and coastal. Atoll lagoons form when an island completely subsides beneath the water, leaving a ring of coral that continues to grow upwards. At the center of the ring is a body of water that is often deep. The combination of coral growth and water creates a lagoon. It may take as long as 300,000 years for an atoll formation to occur.\nCoastal lagoons form along gently sloping coasts. They are generally shallower than atoll lagoons and tend to be separated from the ocean by an island, reef, or sand bank. Most of the time, coastal lagoons are connected to the ocean by an inlet.\nSea level rise, the amount of existing sediment, and tidal range all contribute to the formation of coastal lagoons. Younger and more dynamic than atoll lagoons, coastal lagoons may have shorter 'lifespans' due to their exposed locations on the shore.",,,

In current, the water particles also move along with it. \nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,C,"• The water in the ocean is constantly moving. On the surface we see water moving in he form of waves. Below the surface the water moves in great currents. \nOcean Waves\n• One of the things many people love about the ocean is the waves. People love to play in the waves, surf the waves, and the sound of the waves crashing on the beach. \nWhat causes ocean waves?\n• Ocean waves are caused by wind moving across the surface of the water. The friction between the air molecules and the water molecules causes energy to be transferred from the wind to the water. This causes waves to form. \nWhat is a wave?\n• In science, a wave is defined as a transfer of energy. Ocean waves are called mechanical waves because they travel through a medium. The medium in this case is water. The water doesn't actually travel with the wave, but only moves up and down. It's the energy that travels with the wave. You can go here to learn more about the science of waves. \nWhat are swells? \n• Swells are rolling waves that travel long distances through the ocean. They are not generated by the local wind, but by distant storms. Swells are typically smooth waves, not choppy like wind waves. A swell is measured from the crest (top) to the trough (bottom). \nOcean Currents\n• An ocean current is a continuous flow of water in the ocean. Some currents are surface currents while other currents are much deeper flowing hundreds of feet below the surface of the water.\nWhat causes ocean currents? \n• Surface currents are usually caused by the wind. As the wind changes, the current may change as well. Currents are also influenced by the rotation of the Earth called the Coriolis effect. This causes currents to flow clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter clockwise in the southern hemisphere.\n• Deep ocean currents are caused by a number of things including changes in the temperature, salinity (how salty the water is), and density of the water. \n• One other factor impacting ocean currents is the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun. \nWorld wide ocean currents\n(Click on picture to see large view)\nDo currents impact the climate?\n• Ocean currents can have a significant impact on climate. In some areas warm water is moved from the equator to a colder region causing the region to be warmer.\n• One example of this is the Gulfstream current. It pulls warm water from the equator to the coast of Western Europe. As a result, areas such as the United Kingdom are typically much warmer than areas at the same northern latitude in North America. \n• Interesting Facts about Ocean Waves and Currents\n• The tallest wave ever measured was 1719 feet at Lituya Bay, Alaska.\n• The tallest wave recorded in the open ocean was 95 feet during a storm near Scotland.\n• Surface currents are important to ships as they can make it easy or difficult to travel depending on the direction of the current.\n• Some marine animals take advantage of currents to migrate thousands of miles to and from breeding grounds.\n• Ben Franklin published a map of the Gulf Stream in 1769.",,,
,12,"Identify the coastlines of submergence from the following\n1. Ria coast\n2. Fiord coast\n3. Estuarine coast\n4. Uplifted lowland coast\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below.","1, 2 and 3 only","1, 3 and 4 only","2, 3 and 4 only","1, 2, 3 and 4",A,"Emergent Coasts\n• Emergent coasts are a result of local tectonic uplift of the land surface or a fall in the elevation of sea level because of a reduction in the water volume of ocean basins. Quite often, emergent coasts have rocky coastlines with cliffs and nearly flat platforms that extend inland where older coastal plains have been tectonically raised and are now elevated above the modern land and water interface. A very good example of an emergent coastline, because of its proximity to an active plate tectonic margin, is the west coast of North America. Parts of the Scandinavian coastline (Sweden and Norway) are also emergent where the land surface has been rebounding upward due to the removal of the weight of glacial ice that formed during the last Ice Age, but has since melted.\nSubmergent Coasts\n• Submergent Coasts are those that have been flooded by ocean waters because of a relative rise in the elevation of sea level at that location. The rise in sea level can be either the result of an increase in the volume of water in the ocean basins or the result of the land surface sinking, both of which create an apparent rise in the elevation of sea level. A common feature of submergent coastal zones is river valleys or glacially-carved valleys that have been flooded by ocean water. The Chesapeake Bay of the eastern United States is a classic example of a river valley that extended to the edge of the continental shelf during the last Ice Age when ocean waters were stored in the ice sheets. As the ice age ended, ice sheets melted, and sea level rose, the river valley was flooded with marine waters to create the Chesapeake Bay.\n• Type # 1. Coastlines of Submergence:\ni. Ria Coast:\n• During the Ice Age a great deal of water was locked up in ice. The warmer climate that followed melted much of the ice. Subsequently there was an increase in the waters of the oceans and the sea level rose appreciably. In some cases it is estimated that there was a rise of almost 300 feet!\n• In upland coastal regions where the mountains run at right angles to the sea, that is transverse or discordant to the coast (Fig. 83), a rise in the sea level submerges or drowns the lower parts of the valleys to form long, narrow branching inlets separated by narrow head¬lands. They differ from fiords in two important respects, i.e. they are not glaciated, and their depth increases seawards.\n• A ria coast is typical of the Atlantic type of coast like those of north-west France, north-west Spain, south-west Ireland, Devon and Cornwall. As rias are generally backed by highland, they support few large commercial ports though they have deep water and offer sheltered anchorage. They have been extensively used for siting fishing ports and naval bases such as Plymouth and Brest.\nii. Fiord Coast:\n• Fiords are submerged U-shaped glacial troughs. They mark the paths of glaciers that plunged down from the highlands. They have steep walls, often rising straight from the sea, with tributary branches joining the main inlet at right angles.\n• Due to the greater intensity of ice erosion fiords are deep for great distances inland but there is a shallow section at the seaward end formed by a ridge of rock and called the threshold . Off the fiord coast are numerous islands or skerries which, with the shallow thresholds, sometimes only 200 feet deep, complicate coastal navigation.\n• Fiord coasts are almost entirely confined to the higher latitudes of the temperate regions which were once glaciated e.g. Norway, Alaska, British Columbia, southern Chile and the South Island of New Zealand. Some of the large fiords are extremely long and deep. For example the Sogne Fiord of Norway is 110 miles long, 4 miles wide and almost 4,000 feet deep in its mid-channel.\n• Despite their deep and sheltered water, few large ports are located in fiords. Their mountainous background with poor accessibility inland, attract few settlements. Agriculture is confined to the deltaic fans, built up where streams flow down to the fiords. The few towns that exist either as fishing or market centres e.g. Trondheim, are only of local importance.\niii. Dalmatian Coast:\n• This is the longitudinal coast where mountains run parallel or concordant to the coast. The name is taken from the coast of Dalmatia, Yugoslavia, along the Adriatic Sea, where the submer-gence of the coastline produces long, narrow inlets with a chain of islands parallel to the coast.\n• The elongated islands are the crests of former ranges and the narrow sounds were the former longitudinal valleys. The Dalmatian type of coast is also typical of the Pacific coast where the ranges are parallel to the coast e.g. western coasts of North and South America but there the coastline is more regular.\n• Like the ria and fiord coasts, the moun¬tainous nature of the Dalmatian coastline hinders communication inland. It has deep, sheltered har¬bours but no distinguished ports. On the Pacific coast, however, there are some important ports such as San Francisco.\niv. Estuarine Coast:\n• In submerged lowlands, the mouths of rivers are drowned so that funnel-shaped estuaries are formed. If their entrances are not silted by moving sand-banks, they make excellent sites for ports, e.g. the estuaries of the Thames, Elbe and Plate are the sites of such great seaports as London, Hamburg and Buenos Aires.\n• Tidal effects further enhance the value of the ports and even when there is a little silting, modern dredges help to keep the ports open all the time.\n• Type # 2. Coastlines of Emergence:\n• i. Uplifted Lowland Coast:\n• The uplift of part of the continental shelf produces a smooth, gently sloping coastal lowland (Fig. 86). The offshore waters are shallow with lagoons, salt-marshes and mud-flats. Where the emergent deposits from the continental shelves are sandy and gravelly, beaches and marine dunes are formed. Ports that were once located on the former coast become inland towns.\n• Examples of uplifted lowland coasts include the south-eastern U.S.A., western Finland, eastern Sweden and parts of coastal Argentina south of the Rio de la Plata.\nii. Emergent Upland Coast:\n• Faulting and earth move¬ment may thrust up coastal plateaux so that the whole region is raised, with consequent emergent features. A raised beach is the most prominent. The raised beach is beyond the reach of the waves, though it may still possess arches, stacks and other coastal features.\n• The emergent upland coast is quite straight with steep cliffs and deeper off-shore water, for the waves have not yet eroded lines of weakness or carved a wave-cut platform . It has little potential for good port sites. Examples of emergent upland coasts are found in Scotland, the western coast of the Deccan, India and the western Arabian coast facing the Red Sea.",,,

The effect of winds is comparatively more pronounced in the Indian Ocean.\n• Winter Circulation\n• Under the influence of prevailing trade winds [easterly trade winds], the north equatorial current and the south equatorial current start from the south of Indonesian islands, moving from east to west.\n• This raises the level of western Indian (south-east of horn of Africa) ocean by few centimeters. And this creates a counter-equatorial current which flows between the north equatorial current and the south equatorial current in west-east direction.\n• The north-east monsoons drive the water along the coast of Bay of Bengal to circulate in an anti-clockwise direction.\n• Similarly, the water along the coast of Arabian Sea also circulate in an anti-clockwise circulation.\n• Summer Circulation – North Equatorial Current Counter-Equatorial Current are Absent\n• In summer, due to the effects of the strong south-west monsoon and the absence of the north-east trades, a strong current flows from west to east, which completely obliterates the north equatorial current. Hence, there is no counter-equatorial current as well.\n• Thus, the circulation of water in the northern part of the ocean is clockwise during this season.\n• Southern Indian Ocean Currents – Agulhas current, Mozambique current, West Australian current\n• The general pattern of circulation in southern part of the Indian Ocean is quite similar to that of southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It is less marked by the seasonal changes.\n• The south equatorial current, partly led by the corresponding current of the Pacific Ocean, flows from east to west.\n• It splits into two branches, one flowing to the east of Madagascar known as Agulhas current and the other between Mozambique and Western Madagascar coast known as Mozambique current.\n• At the southern tip of Madagascar, these two branches mix and are commonly called as the Agulhas current. It still continues to be a warm current, till it merges with the West Wind Drift.\n• The West Wind Drift, flowing across the ocean in the higher latitudes from west to east, reaches the southern tip of the west coast, of Australia.\n• One of the branches of this cold current turns northwards along the west coast of Australia. This current, known as the West Australian current, flows northward to feed the south equatorial current.",,,

One type is the foehn wind. This type of wind is a characteristic of mountainous areas such as the Rocky Mountains and the Alps. The wind off of the Rocky Mountains in North America is a foehn wind that is called a Chinook wind. The wind is a warm, dry wind that blows down the eastern slope of most mountains.\nA warm wind like this can bring relief from cold winter weather. Foehn winds are formed from warmer and drier air that flows from aloft or above. This wind has the same force of some hurricane winds. Foehn winds can melt and evaporate a foot (0.3 meters) of snow in less than a day! A rapid change in temperature can occur as a result of foehn winds. Temperatures in Granville, ND increased by 83<super>o</super> F (28<super>o</super>C), from -33<super>o</super>F (-36<super>o</super>C) in the morning to 50<super>o</super>F (10<super>o</super>C) in the afternoon of February 21, 1918 because of a Chinook wind coming from the Rocky Mountains!\nIn addition to causing warmer temperatures, foehn winds have other impacts in the areas where they occur. They can cause snow to melt, which may lead to avalanches and flash flooding. Foehn winds can also create fire hazards. The Santa Ana winds in Southern California are an example of foehn winds that have caused large forest fires because the wind causes the fires to burn out of control. Another bad affect of this warm wind depends on the time of year that it occurs. Finally, if the warm foehn winds occur after spring planting, the seeds might not survive because the wind has parched the soil.\nSince this wind is found in mountainous areas, foehn winds can be found all over the world. In Poland, a foehn wind is called halnywiatr. In Romania, this wind is named austru and in Switzerland it is called favogn. Finally, in the Andes the foehn wind, called a puelche, comes off the western side of the mountains.\n• Fohn is a dry not wind descending on the slopes of alps and bring luxuriant weather to switzerland",,,

What matters is that natural processes glued them all together.\nTypes of Rocks\n• There are three basic types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.\n• Extremely common in the Earth's crust, igneous rocks are volcanic and form from molten material. They include not only lava spewed from volcanoes, but also rocks like granite, which are formed by magma that solidifies far underground.\n• Typically, granite makes up large parts of all the continents. The seafloor is formed of a dark lava called basalt, the most common volcanic rock. Basalt is also found in volcanic lava flows, such as those in Hawaii, Iceland, and large parts of the U.S. Northwest.\n• By signing up for this email, you are agreeing to news, offers, and information from National Geographic Partners and our partners. Click here to visit our Privacy Policy. Easy unsubscribe links are provided in every email.\n• Granite rocks can be very old. Some granite, in Australia, is believed to be more than four billion years old, although when rocks get that old, they've been altered enough by geological forces that it's hard to classify them.\n• Sedimentary rocks are formed from eroded fragments of other rocks or even from the remains of plants or animals. The fragments accumulate in low-lying areas—lakes, oceans, and deserts—and then are compressed back into rock by the weight of overlying materials. Sandstone is formed from sand, mudstone from mud, and limestone from seashells, diatoms, or bonelike minerals precipitating out of calcium-rich water.\n• Fossils are most frequently found in sedimentary rock, which comes in layers, called strata.\n• Metamorphic rocks are sedimentary or igneous rocks that have been transformed by pressure, heat, or the intrusion of fluids. The heat may come from nearby magma or hot water intruding via hot springs. It can also come from subduction, when tectonic forces draw rocks deep beneath the Earth's surface.\n• Marble is metamorphosed limestone, quartzite is metamorphosed sandstone, and gneiss, another common metamorphic rock, sometimes begins as granite.",,,

Circum pacific belt is Highly prone to Tsunami\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",1 and 2 only,2 and 3 only,1 and 3 only,None of the above,B,"Ring of Fire\n• The Ring of Fire is a string of volcanoes and sites of seismic activity, or earthquakes, around the edges of the Pacific Ocean.\n• The Ring of Fire is a string of volcanoes and sites of seismic activity, or earthquakes, around the edges of the Pacific Ocean. Roughly 90% of all earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire, and the ring is dotted with 75% of all active volcanoes on Earth. \n• The Ring of Fire isn’t quite a circular ring. It is shaped more like a 40,000-kilometer (25,000-mile) horseshoe. A string of 452 volcanoes stretches from the southern tip of South America, up along the coast of North America, across the Bering Strait, down through Japan, and into New Zealand. Several active and dormant volcanoes in Antarctica, however, 'close' the ring.\nPlate Boundaries\n• The Ring of Fire is the result of plate tectonics. Tectonic plates are huge slabs of the Earth’s crust, which fit together like pieces of a puzzle. The plates are not fixed but are constantly moving atop a layer of solid and molten rock called the mantle. Sometimes these plates collide, move apart, or slide next to each other. Most tectonic activity in the Ring of Fire occurs in these geologically active zones.\nConvergent Boundaries\n• A convergent plate boundary is formed by tectonic plates crashing into each other. Convergent boundaries are often subduction zones, where the heavier plate slips under the lighter plate, creating a deep trench. This subduction changes the dense mantle material into buoyant magma, which rises through the crust to the Earth’s surface. Over millions of years, the rising magma creates a series of active volcanoes known as a volcanic arc.\n• If you were to drain the water out of the Pacific Ocean, you would see a series of deep ocean trenches that run parallel to corresponding volcanic arcs along the Ring of Fire. These arcs create both islands and continental mountain ranges.\n• The Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska, for example, run parallel to the Aleutian Trench. Both geographic features continue to form as the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate. The Aleutian Trench reaches a maximum depth of 7,679 meters (25,194 feet). The Aleutian Islands have 27 of the United States’ 65 historically active volcanoes.  \n• The Andes Mountains of South America run parallel to the Peru-Chile Trench, created as the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The Andes Mountains include the world’s highest active volcano, Nevados Ojos del Salado, which rises to 6,879 meters (over 22,500 feet) along the Chile-Argentina border. Many volcanoes in Antarctica are so geologically linked to the South American part of the Ring of Fire that some geologists refer to the region as the 'Antarctandes'.\nDivergent Boundaries\n• A divergent boundary is formed by tectonic plates pulling apart from each other. Divergent boundaries are the site of seafloor spreading and rift valleys. Seafloor spreading is the process of magma welling up in the rift as the old crust pulls itself in opposite directions. Cold seawater cools the magma, creating new crust. The upward movement and eventual cooling of this magma has created high ridges on the ocean floor over millions of years.\n• The East Pacific Rise is a site of major seafloor spreading in the Ring of Fire. The East Pacific Rise is located on the divergent boundary of the Pacific Plate and the Cocos Plate (west of Central America), the Nazca Plate (west of South America), and the Antarctic Plate. The largest known group of volcanoes on Earth is found underwater along the portion of the East Pacific Rise between the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru. \nTransform Boundaries\n• A transform boundary is formed as tectonic plates slide horizontally past each other. Parts of these plates get stuck at the places where they touch. Stress builds in those areas as the rest of the plates continue to move. This stress causes the rock to break or slip, suddenly lurching the plates forward and causing earthquakes. These areas of breakage or slippage are called faults. The majority of Earth’s faults can be found along transform boundaries in the Ring of Fire.\n• The San Andreas Fault, stretching along the central west coast of North America, is one of the most active faults on the Ring of Fire. It lies on the transform boundary between the North American Plate, which is moving south, and the Pacific Plate, which is moving north. Measuring about 1,287 kilometers (800 miles) long and 16 kilometers (10 miles) deep, the fault cuts through the western part of the U.S. state of California. Movement along the fault caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which destroyed nearly 500 city blocks. The earthquake and accompanying fires killed roughly 3,000 people and left half of the city’s residents homeless.\nHot Spots\n• The Ring of Fire is also home to hot spots, areas deep within the Earth’s mantle from which heat rises. This heat facilitates the melting of rock in the brittle, upper portion of the mantle. The melted rock, known as magma, often pushes through cracks in the crust to form volcanoes. \n• Hot spots are not generally associated with the interaction or movement of Earth’s tectonic plates. For this reason, many geologists do not consider hot spot volcanoes part of the Ring of Fire.\n• Mount Erebus, the most southern active volcano on Earth, sits over the eruptive zone of the Erebus hot spot in Antarctica. This glacier-covered volcano has a lava lake at its summit, and has been consistently erupting since it was first discovered in 1841. \nActive Volcanoes in the Ring of Fire\n• Most of the active volcanoes on The Ring of Fire are found on its western edge, from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, through the islands of Japan and Southeast Asia, to New Zealand. \n• Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand is one of the more active volcanoes in the Ring of Fire, with yearly minor eruptions, and major eruptions occurring about every 50 years. It stands 2,797 meters (9,177 feet) high. Mount Ruapehu is part of the Taupo Volcanic Arc, where the dense Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Australian Plate.\n• Krakatau, perhaps better known as Krakatoa, is an island volcano in Indonesia. Krakatoa erupts less often than Mount Ruapehu, but much more spectacularly. Beneath Krakatoa, the denser Australian Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate. An infamous eruption in 1883 destroyed the entire island, sending volcanic gas, volcanic ash, and rocks as high as 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the air. A new island volcano, Anak Krakatau, has been forming with minor eruptions ever since.\n• Mount Fuji, Japan’s tallest and most famous mountain, is an active volcano in the Ring of Fire. Mount Fuji last erupted in 1707, but recent earthquake activity in eastern Japan may have put the volcano in a 'critical state.' Mount Fuji sits at a 'triple junction,' where three tectonic plates (the Amur Plate, Okhotsk Plate, and Philippine Plate) interact.\n• The Ring of Fire’s eastern half also has a number of active volcanic areas, including the Aleutian Islands, the Cascade Mountains in the western U.S., the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and the Andes Mountains. \n• Mount St. Helens, in the U.S. state of Washington, is an active volcano in the Cascade Mountains. Below Mount St. Helens, both the Juan de Fuca and Pacific plates are being subducted beneath the North American Plate. Mount St. Helens lies on a particularly weak section of crust, which makes it more prone to eruptions. Its historic 1980 eruption lasted 9 hours and covered nearby areas in tons of volcanic ash.\n• Popocatépetl is one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the Ring of Fire. The mountain is one of Mexico’s most active volcanoes, with 15 recorded eruptions since 1519.  The volcano lies on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which is the result of the small Cocos Plate subducting beneath the North American Plate. Located close to the urban areas of Mexico City and Puebla, Popocatépetl poses a risk to the more than 20 million people that live close enough to be threatened by a destructive eruption.\nRing of Fire\n• Geologic features along the Ring of Fire include not only volcanoes, but ocean trenches, mountain trenches, hydrothermal vents, and sites of earthquake activity.",,,

Such connected formations are called columns.\n• Formation\n• Soluble minerals like calcium carbonate (which forms limestone) drip from the ceiling of a cave and deposit themselves on the floor. This quick video depicts the formation of stalactites and slatagmites through an animated diagram:\n• Types\n• Limestone\n• The most common form of stalactites and stalagmites appear in limestone caves, formed of calcium carbonate by dripping water.

Also seen is a column formation due to the meeting and fusion of a stalactite and a stalagmite\n• Lava\n• Another form of stalactites and stalagmites are formed in lava tubes while lava is still actively flowing. The flowing lava takes on the role of mineralized water in limestone caves, depositing material on the ceiling and floor of the lava tube as gravity affects its flow. Unlike limestone formations, lava stalactites and stalagmites are formed in a matter of hours, days, or weeks.\n• Ice\n• Ice stalactites and stalagmites are formed where freezing temperatures solidify dripping water into formations of ice. Like lava formations, ice stalactites and stalagmites can form within hours or days. Due to rising hot air, that water is more likely to form ice stalagmites than ice stalactites.\n• Concrete\n• Stalactites and stalagmites have also been known to form on concrete ceilings and floors.\n• Around the World\n• The world's largest stalactite is located in the White Chamber of the Jeita Grotto, Lebanon.

Ocean currents, abiotic features of the environment, are continuous and directed movements of ocean water. These currents are on the ocean’s surface and in its depths, flowing both locally and globally.\nWinds, water density, and tides all drive ocean currents. Coastal and sea floor features influence their location, direction, and speed. Earth’s rotation results in the Coriolis Effect which also influences ocean currents. Similar to a person trying to walk in a straight line across a spinning merry-go-round, winds and ocean waters get deflected from a straight line path as they travel across the rotating Earth. This phenomenon causes ocean currents in the Northern Hemisphere to veer to the right and in the Southern Hemisphere to the left. Surface Currents\nLarge-scale surface ocean currents are driven by global wind systems that are fueled by energy from the sun. These currents transfer heat from the tropics to the polar regions, influencing local and global climate. The warmGulf Stream originating in the tropical Caribbean, for instance, carries about 150 times more water than the Amazon River. The current moves along the U.S. East Coast across the Atlantic Ocean towards Europe. The heat from the Gulf Stream keeps much of Northern Europe significantly warmer than other places equally as far north.\nDeep ocean currents\nDifferences in water density, resulting from the variability of water temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline), also cause ocean currents. This process is known as thermohaline circulation. In cold regions, such as the North Atlantic Ocean, ocean water loses heat to the atmosphere and becomes cold and dense. When ocean water freezes, forming sea ice, salt is left behind causing surrounding seawater to become saltier and denser. Dense-cold-salty water sinks to the ocean bottom. Surface water flows in to replace the sinking water, which in turn becomes cold and salty enough to sink. This ""starts"" the global conveyer belt, a connected system of deep and surface currents that circulate around the globe on a 1000 year time span. This global set of ocean currents is a critical part of Earth’s climate system as well as the ocean nutrient and carbon dioxide cycles.\nOcean buoy to help close gap in climate understanding\nWe will be able to measure how this powerful current warms the atmosphere and some of the effects this has on the local.\nBiological influence\nOcean currents are an important abiotic factor that significantly influences food webs and reproduction of marine organisms and the marine ecosystems that they inhabit. Many species with limited mobility are dependent on this ""liquid wind"" to bring food and nutrients to them and to distribute larvae and reproductive cells. Even fish and mammals living in the ocean may have their destinations and food supply affected by currents.\nUpwelling currents bring cold nutrient-rich waters from the ocean bottom to the surface, supporting many of the most important fisheries and ecosystems in the world. These currents support the growth of phytoplankton and seaweed which provide the energy base for consumers higher in the food chain, including fish, marine mammals, and humans.",,,
,12,In India, Glacial Terraces 'Karewas' are found in,Sapt kosi valley,Jhelum Valley,Alaknanda Valley,Teesta Valley ,B,"• The Kashmir valley is an oval-shaped basin, 140 km long and 40 km wide, trending in the NNW–SSE direction. It is an intermountain valley fill, comprising of unconsolidated gravel and mud. A succession of plateaus is present above the Plains of Jhelum and its tributaries. These plateau-like terraces are called ‘Karewas’ or ‘Vudr’ in the local language. Despite continuous erosion since millions of years, more than half of the valley is still occupied by the Karewa.\n• Thus, Karewas are lacustrine deposits (deposits in lake) in the Valley of Kashmir and in Bhadarwah Valley of the Jammu Division. These are the flat topped mounds that border the Kashmir Valley on all sides. They are characterized with fossils of mammals and at places by peat. Karewas were formed during the Pleistocene Period (1 million years ago), when the entire Valley of Kashmir was under water. Due to the rise of Pirpanjal, the drainage was impounded and a lake of about 5000 sq. km area was developed and thus a basin was formed. Subsequently, the lake was drained through Bramulla gorge. The deposits left in the process are known as karewas. The thickness of karewas is about 1400 m.\n• The karewas have been elevated, dissected and removed by subaerial denudation to be in the present position.\n• The Karewa deposits in the Kashmir valley have been conventionally divided into two stages, lower and upper, representing argillaceous and arenaceous facies respectively. The upper Karewas are less fossiliferous than the lower Karewas. The entire belt touching the foothills of the Pirpanjal represents the lower Karewas, which has been exposed to the rivers starting from the south such as Veshav, Rembiara, Romushu, Dodhganga, Shaliganga, Boknag nar and Ningli. Lower Karewa sections at Aharbal, Anantnag, Arigam, Baramulla have been exposed by these rivers.\n• The rest of the Karewa sediments occupy the middle of the entire flank of the valley, including Pampore, Srinagar, Burzuhom, Dilpur, Pattan, Parihaspora, and parts of Baramulla District. These represent upper Karewas of the valley. The late Cenozoic deposits exposed in the Kashmir valley assume special significance as they are extensively fluvioglacial, fluvial, lacustrine and eolian in origin. The age determination of a Karewa is based on the correlation between Karewa and Shiwalik fauna from India and Pakistan. As far as the age of Karewas is concerned, the lack of chronological control has impeded the development of a detailed reconstruction of the Karewas depositional history in the intermountain basin of the valley.",,,

They are corrasion, corrosion, hydraulic action etc.\n• Corrasion or Abration: As the rock particles bounce, scrape and drag along the bottom and sides of the river, they break off additional rock fragments. This form of erosion is called corrasion or abration. They are two types: vertical corrosion which acts downward and lateral corrosion which acts on both sides.\n• Corrosion or Solution: This is the chemical or solvent action of water on soluble or partly soluble rocks with which the river water comes in contact.\n• Hydraulic Action: This is the mechanical loosening and sweeping away of material by the sheer force or river water itself. No load or material is involved in this process.\n• Transportation types\n• After erosion, the eroded materials get transported with the running water. This transportation of eroded materials is carried in four ways:\n• Traction: The heavier and larger rock fragments like gravels, pebbles etc are forced by the flow of the river to roll along its bed. These fragments can be seen rolling, slipping, bumping and being dragged. This process is called as traction and the load transported in this way are called traction load.\n• Saltation: Some of the fragments of the rocks move along the bed of a stream by jumping or bouncing continuously. This process is called as saltation.\n• Suspension: The holding up of small particles of sand, silt and mud by the water as the stream flows is called suspension.\n• Solution: Some parts of the rock fragments dissolved in the river water and transported. This type of transportation is called solution transportation.\n• traction, saltation, solution, suspension\n• When the stream comes down from the hills to plain areas with the eroded and transported materials, the absence of slope/gradient causes the river to lose it energy to further carry those transported materials.\n• As a result, the load of the river starts to settle down which is termed as deposition.\n• Erosion, transportation, and deposition continue until the slopes are almost completely flattened leaving finally a lowland of faint relief called peneplains with some low resistant remnants called monadnocks.\n• Erosional Landforms due to Running Water\n Valleys, Gorges, Canyon \n• As we discussed above, valleys are formed as a result of running water.\n• The rills which are formed by the overland flow of water later develop into gullies.\n• These gullies gradually deepen and widen to form valleys.\n• A gorge is a deep valley with very steep to straight sides.\n• A canyon is characterized by steep step-like side slopes and may be as deep as a gorge.\n• A gorge is almost equal in width at its top as well as bottom and is formed in hard rocks while a canyon is wider at its top than at its bottom and is formed in horizontal bedded sedimentary rocks.\n• Gorge and canyon2. Potholes, Plunge pools\n• Potholes are more or less circular depressions over the rocky beds of hills streams.\n• Once a small and shallow depression forms, pebbles and boulders get collected in those depressions and get rotated by flowing water. Consequently, the depressions grow in dimensions to form potholes.\n• Plunge pools are nothing but large, deep potholes commonly found at the foot of a waterfall.\n• They are formed because of the sheer impact of water and rotation of boulders.\n• Potholes - erosional landform due to running waterPlunge pool - erosional landform due to running water\n Incised or Entrenched Meanders\n• They are very deep wide meanders (loop-like channels) found cut in hard rocks.\n• In the course of time, they deepen and widen to form gorges or canyons in hard rock.\n• The difference between a normal meander and an incised/entrenched meander is that the latter found on hard rocks.\n• entrenched meander - running water erosion4. River Terraces\n• They are surfaces marking old valley floor or flood plains.\n• They are basically the result of vertical erosion by the stream.\n• When the terraces are of the same elevation on either side of the river, they are called as paired terraces.\n• When the terraces are seen only on one side with none on the other or one at quite a different elevation on the other side, they are called as unpaired terraces.\n• river terraces - running water landfrom due to erosion\n• Depositional Landforms due to Running Water\n Alluvial Fans\n• They are found in the middle course of a river at the foot of slope/ mountains.\n• When the stream moves from the higher level break into foot slope plain of low gradient, it loses its energy needed to transport much of its load.\n• Thus, they get dumped and spread as a broad low to the high cone-shaped deposits called an alluvial fan.\n• The deposits are not roughly very well sorted.\n• alluvial fan - running water deposition2. Deltas\n• Deltas are like an alluvial fan but develop at a different location.\n• They are found in the mouth of the river, which is the final location of depositional activity of a river.\n• Unlike alluvial fans, the deposits making up deltas are very well sorted with clear stratification.\n• The coarser material settle out first and the finer materials like silt and clay are carried out into the sea.\n Flood Plains, Natural Levees\n• Deposition develops a flood plain just as erosion makes valleys.\n• A riverbed made of river deposits is the active flood plain and the flood plain above the bank of the river is the inactive flood plain.\n• Natural levees are found along the banks of large rivers. They are low, linear and parallel ridges of coarse deposits along the banks of a river.\n• The levee deposits are coarser than the deposits spread by flood water away from the river.\n• Meanders and oxbow lakes\n• Meanders are loop-like channel patterns develop over the flood and delta plains.\n• They are actually not a landform but only a type of channel pattern formed as a result of deposition.\n• They are formed basically because of three reasons: (i) propensity of water flowing over very gentle gradient to work laterally on the banks; (ii) unconsolidated nature of alluvial deposits making up the bank with many irregularities; (iii) Coriolis force acting on fluid water deflecting it like deflecting the wind.\n• The concave bank of a meander is known as cut-off bank and the convex bank is known as a slip-off\n• As meanders grow into deep loops, the same may get cut-off due to erosion at the inflection point and are left as oxbow lakes.\n• For large rivers, the sediments deposited in a linear fashion at the depositional side of a meander are called as Point Bars or Meander Bars.\n• oxbow lake and a meanderbraided channels due to running water deposition5. Braided Channels\n• When selective deposition of coarser materials causes the formation of a central bar, it diverts the flow of river towards the banks, which increases lateral erosion.\n• Similarly, when more and more such central bars are formed, braided channels are formed.\n• Riverine Islands are the result of braided channels.\n• What does Groundwater do?\n• The part of rain or snow-melt water which accumulates in the rocks after seeping through the surface is called underground water or simply groundwater.\n• The rocks through which water can pass easily are called as permeable rocks while the rocks which do not allow water to pass are called as impermeable rocks.\n• After vertically going down to some depth, the water under the ground flows horizontally through the bedding planes, joints or through the materials themselves.\n• Although the amount of groundwater varies from place to place, its role in shaping the surface features of the earth is quite important.\n• The works of groundwater are mainly seen in rocks like limestone, gypsum or dolomite which are rich in calcium carbonate.\n• Any limestone, dolomite or gypsum region showing typical landforms produced by the action of groundwater through the process of solution and deposition is called as Karst Topography (Karst region in the Balkans)\n• The zones or horizons of permeable and porous rocks which are fully filled with water are called as the Zones of Saturation.\n• The marks which show the upper surface of these saturated zones of the groundwater are called as the Water Tables.\n• And these rocks, which are filled with underground water, are called as aquifers.\n• The water table is generally higher in the areas of high precipitation and also in areas bordering rivers and lakes.\n• They also vary according to seasons. On the basis of variability, water tables are of two types: (i) Permanent water table, in which the water will never fall below a certain level and wells dug up to this depth provide water in all seasons; (ii) Temporary water tables, which are seasonal water tables.\n• Springs: They are the surface outflow of groundwater through an opening in a rock under hydraulic pressure.\n• When such springs emit hot water, they are called as Hot Springs. They generally occur in areas of active or recent volcanism.\n• When a spring emits hot water and steam in the form of fountains or jets at regular intervals, they are called as geysers.\n• In a geyser, the period between two emissions is sometimes regular (Yellowstone National Park of USA is the best example).\n• Erosional Landforms due to Groundwater\n• Sinkholes and caves are erosional landforms formed due to the action of ground water.\n Sinkholes\n• Small to medium sized rounded to sub-rounded shallow depressions called swallow holes forms on the surface of rocks like limestone by the action of the solution.\n• A sinkhole is an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom.\n• When as sinkhole is formed solely through the process of solution, it is called as a solution sink.\n• Some sinkhole starts its formation through the solution process but later collapse due to the presence of some caves or hollow beneath it and becomes a bigger sinkhole. These types are called as collapse sinks.\n• The term Doline is sometimes used to refer collapse sinks.\n• Solution sinks are more common than collapse sinks.\n• When several sink holes join together to form valley of sinks, they are called as valley sinks or Uvalas.\n• Lapies are the irregular grooves and ridges formed when most of the surfaces of limestone are eaten by solution process.\n• sinkholes - groundwater -erosioncollapse sink - groundwater - erosion2. Caves\n• In the areas where there are alternative beds of rocks (non-soluble) with limestone or dolomite in between or in areas where limestone are dense, massive and occurring as thick beds, cave formation is prominent.\n• Caves normally have an opening through which cave streams are discharged\n• Caves having an opening at both the ends are called tunnels.\n• Depositional Landforms of Groundwater\n Stalactites and stalagmites\n• They are formed when the calcium carbonates dissolved in groundwater get deposited once the water evaporates.\n• These structures are commonly found in limestone caves.\n• Stalactites are calcium carbonate deposits hanging as icicles while Stalagmites are calcium carbonate deposits which rise up from the floor.\n• When a stalactite and stalagmite happened to join together, it gives rise to pillars or columns of different diameters.\n• limestone caves- stalagmite-stalactite",,,
,12,"Consider the following statements:\n1. Gorges are formed where the rocks are resistant.\n2. Canyons are formed in arid regions of valley.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct? ",1 only,2 only,Both 1 and 2,Neither 1 nor 2,C,"• Canyons and gorges are geographical landforms belonging to the broad categories of valleys. Morphologically, they are either V-shaped or U-shaped with a down ward fold extending below the earth surface. They are classically low areas and could be separating mountains or hills. More often than not, canyons and gorges have rivers streaming through them and are usually very long and narrow. They are often considered deep valleys with very steep escarpments. Though these terms have been utilized interchangeably, there exists some critical differences between a canyon and a gorge in terms of size, mode of formation, localization and preference of usage of the terms.\nDifferences Between A Canyon And A Gorge\n• In terms of the proportions of the two, a canyon is considered larger than a gorge. They are both deep valleys, but a canyon is often wider compared to a gorge. The term gorge is at times used to describe ravines which are narrower than canyons. Canyons are mainly localized to the arid areas while gorges can be found in temperate areas like between mountain ranges. While water or lava flow is implicated in the formation of gorges, erosion from a plateau level coupled with resistance of hard rocks to weathering is the manner in which canyons are formed. Often, gorges are associated with rivers while canyons are not. Despite the geographical differences, in the United States the term canyon is widely applied to refer to both canyons and gorges. In Europe however, the term gorge is more preferred.\nFormation Of Canyons\n• Erosion, is the weathering process that leads to the formation of canyons. This begins at the table land level and continues downwards. Hard rock is resistant to this weathering process, thus remains on the escarpments in form of granite and sandstones. Major canyons in the world include the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon in the Unites States of America, the Fish River Canyon in Namibia and the Grand Canyon of northern Arizona.\nFormation Of Gorges\n• Gorges form via three forms of natural forces: erosion, geological uplift and glaciers melting. Erosion and washing away of the sediments caused by rivers and streams in valleys is responsible for formation of most gorges in the world. The Talari Gorges in Mali were formed in this manner. Upward movement of the Earth’s surface termed the geologic uplift has been implicated in formation of these land forms. In most cases, geologic uplift works hand in hand with erosion. These two forces led to the formation of Macocha Gorge in Czech Republic. The Colombia River Gorge in Washington was formed via melting of glaciers, which is the third force that leads to gorges creation.\nSignificance Of Canyons And Gorges\n• Canyons and gorges are a geographical fascinations known for tourist attraction which often contributes to countries’ economies. They also provide education regarding changes in land forms in their tales of modes of formation. Some of these landforms are important archaeological sites documenting early human life by way of remains of ancient plants and animal remains. An example is the Olduvai Gorge cited by the Leakey family as famous for ancient tools and fossils. Dams built along the rivers streaming through the gorges are often important sources of energy, example being the Three Gorges Dam.",,,
,12,"Consider the following statements:\n1. Rotation of Earth\n2. Air Pressure and wind\n3. Density of Ocean water\n4. Revolution of Earth\nWhich of the above factors influence ocean currents?",1 and 2 only,"1, 2 and 3",1 and 4 only,"2, 3 and 4 only",B,"• Surface currents are generated largely by wind. Their patterns are determined by wind direction, Coriolis forces from the Earth’s rotation, and the position of landforms that interact with the currents.  Surface wind-driven currents generate upwelling currents in conjunction with landforms, creating deepwater currents.\n• Currents may also be generated by density differences in water masses caused by temperature and salinity variations.  These currents move water masses through the deep ocean—taking nutrients, oxygen, and heat with them. \n• Occasional events also trigger serious currents. Huge storms move water masses. Underwater earthquakes may trigger devastating tsunamis. Both move masses of water inland when they reach shallow water and coastlines. Earthquakes may also trigger rapid downslope movement of water-saturated sediments, creating turbidity currents strong enough to snap submarine communication cables.\n• Bottom currents scour and sort  sediments, thus affecting what kind of bottom develops in an area—hard or soft, fine grained or coarse. Bottom substrate (material) determines what kinds of communities may develop in an area.\n• Finally, when a current that is moving over a broad area is forced into a confined space, it may become very strong. On the ocean floor, water masses forced through narrow openings in a ridge system or flowing around a seamount may create currents that are far greater than in the surrounding water—affecting the distribution and abundance of organisms as well as the scientists and their equipment seeking to study them.",,,
,12,Variation in length of day time and night time from season to season are not due to,Earth’s rotation on its axis,Earth’s revolution in elliptical orbit,Latitudinal position of the place,Revolution of Earth on tilt axis,B,"• The change between day and night is caused by the rotation of the Earth on its axis. If the Earth did not rotate as it does, the day/night cycle would be very different or possibly even nonexistent. The changing lengths of days and nights depends on where you are on Earth and the time of year. Also, daylight hours are affected by the tilt of the Earth's axis and its path around the sun.\nLength of a Rotation\n• A solar day, 24 hours, is the time it takes for the Earth to rotate exactly once so that the sun appears at the same place in the sky the next day. However, the Earth is also moving around the sun, and this movement makes measuring the day somewhat complicated. The actual time of one Earth rotation is a little shorter – about 23 hours and 56 minutes. Astronomers discovered this by observing the time it took for a star to appear in the same place in the sky the following day, and they called this a sidereal day.\nLonger and Shorter Days\n• Although a solar day is 24 hours, not every day has 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night. Daytime is shorter in winter than in summer. This is because the Earth’s imaginary axis isn’t straight up and down, it is tilted 23.5 degrees. As the Earth moves around the sun during a year, the northern half of the Earth is tilted towards the sun in the summer, making daytime longer than night. In winter, this reverses; the earth tilts away from the sun and nighttime becomes longer. In the spring and fall, the tilt is neither toward or away from the sun but somewhere between, so day and night are more the same at these times of the year.",,,

Conversely, monthly mean temperatures can be inferred approximately from geographic information. The extent to which these normative estimates differ from actuality offers clues on the effects on climate of regional features of topography and ocean circulation, as well as on microclimatic effects.\n1. Geography and climate\nIt has long been assumed that climate is largely controlled by location or geography. In the sixth century BC, the Greek philosopher Pythagoras recognised the sphericity of the Earth and the dominance of latitude in explaining climate variation (Sanderson 1999). Two centuries later Aristotle expanded on Pythagoras's foundation and introduced five climate zones, ranging from tropical to northern frigid. It is not coincidental that in the early 20th century German scientist Koeppen also used 5 climate zones in his classification, identified with the letters A-E.\nKoeppen's classification was developed at a time when it was widely believed, especially in the German scientific arena, that climate, and therefore geography determined flora and fauna, even the physical and behavioural traits of human societies. Obviously such determinism has its limitations, but it highlights the widespread and longstanding belief that location determines climate. More recent work by Geiger (1960) indicates that even the microclimate is largely controlled by the local 'geographical' conditions, such as orography and coastlines.\nGiven this control one could hypothesise that one can infer the place where given climatic data were obtained. In other words, can we work out the one or more locations where a station may be, even approximately, if we are given its climatic record? This is the key question addressed herein.\nThe basic information is outlined elsewhere (1). In brief, the main governing factors can be summarised as these -\ni. hemisphere - which leads to warmer conditions, or, in the Tropics (23.5� S-23.5� N), to wetter conditions, in either January (south) or July (north);\nii. latitude - which affects a) the annual mean temperature, b) the annual range, c) the annual total rainfall (which is least around the Tropics and near the poles), d) the prevailing wind direction and strength;\niii. elevation - which affects a) the annual mean temperature, b) precipitation, and c) the daily range of temperature;\niv. distance inland - the annual temperature range increases with the distance downwind of the coast, and at all latitudes but the equatorial belt (5� S-5� N) the climate is drier and more rain falls in summer;\nv. sea surface temperature upwind - anomalously high SSTs (for a given latitude) means warmth and rain onshore - conversely, upwelling or cold water advection stabilises the atmosphere and inhibits rainfall;\nvi. upwind topography - an upwind mountain chain implies drier conditions, but also colder winters, because of easy advection of polar airmasses along the mountain chain;\nvii. local topography - e.g. low daily minima in broad valleys, but higher ones in urban canyons; or reduced daily maxima near large bodies of water on account of a lake breeze.\nThese factors suggest that the following information should be sufficient (2):\n• Annual mean temperature\n• Monthly mean temperatures (possibly reduced to annual temperature range)\n• Monthly-mean daily temperature range (or merely its annual mean)\n• Monthly mean precipitation\n• Distance inland, relative to the prevailing surface wind direction\n• Local topographic information",,,

,12,If a tropical rainforest is removed is does not regenerated quickly are compared to tropical deciduous forest why?,Soil of rainforest is deficient in nutrients.,Prologues of rain forest trees have poor viability.,Rainforest species are slow growing.,Exotics invade the fertile soil or rainforest. ,A,"Soil and Nutrient Recycling \nMost tropical rainforest soils relatively poor in nutrients. Millions of years of weathering and torrential rains have washed most of the nutrients out of the soil. More recent volcanic soils, however, can be very fertile. Tropical rain forest soils contain less organic matter than temperate forests and most of the available nutrients are found in the living plant and animal material. Nutrients in the soil are often in forms that are not accessible by plants.\nConstant warmth and moisture promote rapid decay of organic matter. When a tree dies in the rainforest, living organisms quickly absorb the nutrients before they have a chance to be washed away. When tropical forests are cut and burned, heavy rains can quickly wash the released nutrients away, leaving the soil even more impoverished. ",,,

Which are among the following pair of crops is most suited for this region.,Paddy and Cotton,Wheat and Jute,Paddy and Jute,Wheat and Cotton,C,"Three major landforms, Uplands, Old Fluvial/Deltaic Plains and Young Fluvial Plains are identified from the Lower Gangetic Plains of West Bengal, India, on the basis of remote sensing and field studies. Morphologic, quantitative and thermoluminescence studies of soils of the study area have been conducted. Two types of Uplands are recognised: Upland in the west overlain by red soils (autochthonous and allochthonous types) and upland in the north (Barind Tract), characterised by three topographic levels. Aspects of the autochthonous Upland Red Soils (Lower to Middle Pleistocene age) show the ferrugination (ferrisol) phase of development. Soils of the Old Fluvial/Deltaic Plains (6–3 ka) and Lower Level of the Barind Tract have argillic horizons and exhibit the fersiallitisation phase of development. Development of ferrugination and fersiallitisation phases was favored due to the pre-weathered nature of the parent material. Soils of the Old Fluvial/Deltaic Plains, Barind Tract (Lower Level) and Young Fluvial Plains show effects of hydromorphism due to waterlogging in the form of segregations of Fe–Mn oxides/gleying and chloritisation, probably due to ferrolysis in the upper horizons of some of these soils. Neotectonics seems to have affected development of landforms and soils significantly. Due to reactivation of some basement faults in the western region, some tectonic blocks subsided, causing transgression during the Early Pleistocene and at ca. 7 ka. Subsequent uplift of these blocks caused regressions and development of soils on the exposed landscapes. Episodic uplift of the Barind Tract in the northern region may have given rise to three topographic levels. Some faults confine the courses of the Damodar, Ganga and Bhagirathi rivers.",,,
,12,Identify characteristic feature of mixed farming ,Cultivation of both cash and food crop,Cultivation of two or more crop on same filed,Rearing of animal and cultivation of crops together,None of the above,C,"Mixed farming is an agricultural system in which a farmer conducts different agricultural practice together, such as cash crops and livestock. The aim is to increase income through different sources and to complement land and labour demands across the year.\nDescription: \nMixed farming systems can be classified in many ways. They can be based on land size, type of crops and animals, geographical distribution, market orientation, and so on. Three major categories are distinguished here (FAO, 2001).\n•  On-farm versus Between-farm Mixing\nOn-farm mixing refers to mixing on the same farm, and between-farm mixing refers to exchanging resources between different farms. On-farm mixing enables the recycling of resources generated on a single farm. Between-farm mixing can be used to resolve waste disposal problems where by crop farmers use dung from animal farms for fertiliser. \n•  Mixing within Crops and/or Animal Systems \nThis practice involves multiple cropping or keeping different types of animals together. For example, grain-legume association can provide grain with nitrogen. With plant inter-cropping farmers can make the most of the space available to them by selecting plants and cropping formations that maximise the advantage of light, moisture and soil nutrients.  Examples of mixed animal systems include chicken-fish production where chicken dung serves as fish fodder.\n•  Diversified versus Integrated Systems\nIn a diversified system some components exist as independent units. In an integrated system, maximum use is made of resources, making the system highly interdependent.\nMixed farming technology contributes to adaptation to climatic change because the diversification of crops and livestock allows farmers to have a greater number of options to face the uncertain weather conditions associated with the increased climate variability. Mixed farming can also give a more stable production because if one crop or variety fails, another may compensate. Livestock represents a means by which families can save and invest in the future. Livestock is a walking bank of assets that can be sold during periods of need such as if crops fail due to drought or flooding. \nAdvantages of the technology\nThis technology also allows greater food security and improved household nutrition levels. In addition, farmers can generate a surplus of some products that can be sold at market. Among other benefits, this technology also allows farmers to grow fodder for livestock and poultry.  An additional benefit of mixed rice–fish culture systems is that the fish may help reduce populations of existing and emerging disease vectors such as mosquitoes.",,,

What are effect of salinization on irrigated land?",Greatly improves productivity of crops,It males soil impermeable, It raise water table,It fill air spaces in soil with water. ,B,"Saline irrigation water contains dissolved substances known as salts. In much of the arid and semi-arid United States (including Montana), most of the salts present in irrigation water are chlorides, sulfates, carbonates, and bicarbonates of calcium magnesium, sodium, and potassium. While salinity can improve soil structure, it can also negatively affect plant growth and crop yields.\nSodicity refers specifically to the amount of sodium present in irrigation water.Irrigating with water that has excess amounts of sodium can adversely impact soil structure, making plant growth difficult. Highly saline and sodic water qualities can cause problems for irrigation, depending on the type and amount of salts present, the soil type being irrigated, the specific plant species and growth stage, and the amount of water able to pass through the root zone.\nSoil water salinity can affect soil physical properties by causing fine particles to bind together into aggregates. This process is known as flocculation and is beneficial in terms of soil aeration, root penetration, and root growth. Although increasing soil solution salinity has a positive effect on soil aggregation and stabilization, at high levels salinity can have negative and potentially lethal effects on plants. As a result, salinity cannot be increased to maintain soil structure without considering potential impacts on plant health.",,,

It encompasses a large area of 720 hectares and is situated under the Aravalli range. The Park is famous for its vast flora and fauna, and its main aim is to conserve it. It also doubles up as a great place to educate people and conduct research on existing flora and fauna. At Nahargarh Biological Park, ornithologists can expect to see over 285 species of birds, of which, the most popular is the white-naped tit, which can only be found here. When you visit the Park, make sure you also head to Ram Sagar, which is a famous among bird watchers and makes for a great spot to catch different varieties of birds. While here, you can stay at well-equipped and famous places such as Ganga Vilas, Gopal Vilas and Lalit Vilas, which were famous with the maharajas of the yore as hunting lodges. The Nahargarh Zoological Park is also worth a visit and houses animals such as Asiatic lions, Bengal tigers, panthers, hyenas, wolves, deer, crocodiles, sloth bear, Himalayan black bear, wild boar, etc.",,,
,12,"Olive Ridley Turtle’s mass nesting is termed as arribadas. This can be seen in which of the following countries?\n1. India\n2. Coasta Rica\n3. Mexico\nSelect the correct answer using the codes given below",1 only,1 and 3 only,2 only,"1, 2 and 3",D,"• The Olive ridley turtles are the smallest and most abundant of all sea turtles found in the world, inhabiting warm waters of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. These turtles, along with their cousin the Kemps ridley turtle, are best known for their unique mass nesting called Arribada, where thousands of females come together on the same beach to lay eggs. Though found in abundance, their numbers have been declining over the past few years, and the species is recognized as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red list.\n• Growing to about 2 feet in length, and 50 kg in weight, the Olive ridley gets its name from its olive colored carapace, which is heart-shaped and rounded. Males and females grow to the same size; however, females have a slightly more rounded carapace as compared to the male. They are carnivores, and feed mainly on jellyfish, shrimp, snails, crabs, molluscs and a variety of fish and their eggs. These turtles spend their entire lives in the ocean, and migrate thousands of kilometers between feeding and mating grounds in the course of a year. \n• Interestingly, females return to the very same beach from where they first hatched, to lay their eggs. During this phenomenal nesting, up to 600,000 and more females emerge from the waters, over a period of five to seven days, to lay eggs. They lay their eggs in conical nests about one and a half feet deep which they laboriously dig with their hind flippers. The coast of Orissa in India is the largest mass nesting site for the Olive-ridley, followed by the coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica. After about 45-65 days, the eggs begin to hatch, and these beaches are swamped with crawling Olive-ridley turtle babies, making their first trek towards the vast ocean. During this trek they are exposed to predators like jackals, birds, hyenas, fiddler crabs, and feral dogs lurking around, waiting to feed on them. WWF-India, along with the fishermen community, has been involved in protecting the Olive ridley rookery at the mass nesting site at Rushikulaya, in Orissa, by fencing off the nesting area and patrolling it till hatching and ensuring a safe passage for the hatchlings to the sea. It is estimated that approximately 1 hatchling survives to reach adulthood for every 1000 hatchlings that enter the sea waters. This may also be the reason why arribadas happen and a single female can lay 80 to 120 eggs and sometimes even twice in a season; to increase the hatchlings survival rate.\n• Olive-ridleys face serious threats across their migratory route, habitat and nesting beaches, due to human activities such as turtle unfriendly fishing practices, development and exploitation of nesting beaches for ports, and tourist centres. Though international trade in these turtles and their products is banned under CITES Appendix I, they are still extensively poached for their meat, shell and leather, and their eggs, though illegal to harvest, have a significantly large market around the coastal regions. However, the most severe threat they face is the accidental killing of adult turtles through entanglement in trawl nets and gill nets due to uncontrolled fishing during their mating season around nesting beaches.\n• To reduce accidental killing in India, the Orissa government has made it mandatory for trawls to use Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs), a net specially designed with an exit cover which allows the turtles to escape while retaining the catch. However, this has been strongly opposed by the fishing communities as they believe TEDs result in loss of considerable amount of the catch along with the turtle. WWF-India, along with its partners, disproved this theory by conducting a study to measure the loss of catch through TEDs, revealing the loss to be a very small percentage of the total catch. This result, along with regular meetings with the fishing communities, is slowly helping to change their mindset and encourage use of TEDs, thereby aiding the conservation of Olive ridley turtles.",,,

,12,Aral sea is located between which of the following countries,Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,Uzbekistan and Tajikistan,Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan,A,"• In the 1960s, the Soviet Union undertook a major water diversion project on the arid plains of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The region’s two major rivers, fed by snowmelt and precipitation in faraway mountains, were used to transform the desert into farms for cotton and other crops. Before the project, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowed down from the mountains, cut northwest through the Kyzylkum Desert, and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin. The lake they made, the Aral Sea, was once the fourth largest in the world.\n• Although irrigation made the desert bloom, it devastated the Aral Sea. This series of images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite documents the changes. At the start of the series in 2000, the lake was already a fraction of its 1960 extent (yellow line). The North Aral Sea (sometimes called the Small Aral Sea) had separated from the South (Large) Aral Sea.\n• The South Aral Sea had split into eastern and western lobes that remained tenuously connected at both ends. By 2001, the southern connection had been severed, and the shallower eastern part retreated rapidly over the next several years. Especially large retreats in the eastern lobe of the South Aral Sea appear to have occurred between 2005 and 2009, when drought limited and then cut off the flow of the Amu Darya. Water levels then fluctuated annually between 2009 and 2018 in alternately dry and wet years. In 2014, the eastern lobe of the South Aral Sea completely disappeared. Water levels in summer 2018 were not as low as they might have been, following a round of seasonal snowmelt in the spring.\n• As the Aral Sea has dried up, fisheries and the communities that depended on them collapsed. The increasingly salty water became polluted with fertilizer and pesticides. The blowing dust from the exposed lakebed, contaminated with agricultural chemicals, became a public health hazard. The salty dust blew off the lakebed and settled onto fields, degrading the soil. Croplands had to be flushed with larger and larger volumes of river water. The loss of the moderating influence of such a large body of water made winters colder and summers hotter and drier.\n• In a last-ditch effort to save some of the lake, Kazakhstan built a dam between the northern and southern parts of the Aral Sea. The Kok-Aral dike and dam, finished in 2005, separates the two water bodies and prevents flow out of the North Aral into the lower-elevation South Aral. The dam has led fisheries in the North Aral to rebound, even as it has limited flow into the South Aral. Between 2005 and 2006, water levels in the North Aral rebounded significantly and very small increases are visible throughout the rest of the time period. The differences in water color are due to changes in sediments and water depth.",,,

,12,"Which of the following are fold mountains?\n1. Aravallis\n2. Rockies\n3. Andes\n4. Himalayas\nSelect the correct answer using the codes give below","1, 2 and 3 only","2, 3 and 4 only","1, 3 and 4 only","1, 2, 3 and 4",D,"• Fold mountains are created where two or more of Earth’s tectonic plates are pushed together. At these colliding, compressing boundaries, rocks and debris are warped and folded into rocky outcrops, hills, mountains, and entire mountain ranges.\n• Fold mountains are created through a process called orogeny. An orogenic event takes millions of years to create a fold mountain, but you can mimic it in seconds. Cover a table with a tablecloth, or place a rug flat on the floor. Now push the edge of the tablecloth or rug—wrinkles will develop and fold on top of each other.\n• The vocabulary of fold mountains owes something to this simple tablecloth experiment. Some of the key structures in fold mountains are nappes. Nappes are common, dramatic folded rocks or rock formations. 'Nappe' is French for 'tablecloth' and the formations were named after the tabletop experiment.\n• The huge difference between the rock folds and cloth folds is that in the tabletop experiment, the table itself does not fold. In the creation of fold mountains, Earth’s crust itself is warped into folded forms.\n• Fold mountains are often associated with continental crust. They are created at convergent plate boundaries, sometimes called continental collision zones or compression zones. Convergent plate boundaries are sites of collisions, where tectonic plates crash into each other. Compression describes a set of stresses directed at one point in a rock or rock formation.\n• At a compression zone, tectonic activity forces crustal compression at the leading edge of the crust formation. For this reason, most fold mountains are found on the edge or former edge of continental plate boundaries. Rocks on the edge of continental crust are often weaker and less stable than rocks found in the continental interior. This makes them more susceptible to folding and warping. Most fold mountains are composed of sedimentary rock and metamorphic rock formed under high pressure and relatively low temperatures. Many fold mountains are also formed where an underlying layer of ductile minerals, such as salt, is present.\nYoung and Old, High and Low\n• Fold mountains are the most common type of mountain in the world. The rugged, soaring heights of the Himalayas, Andes, and Alps are all active fold mountains.\n• The Himalayas stretch through the borders of China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and Pakistan. The crust beneath the Himalaya, the most towering mountain range on Earth, is still the process of being compressed. Here, the Indian plate is colliding northward with the Eurasian plate. The sedimentary rocks of the Himalayas include shale and limestone. Metamorphic rocks of the region include schist and gneiss. Dikes of igneous rock also intrude throughout the rock formations of the Himalayas.\n• The Andes are the world’s longest mountain chain. They stretch along the entire west coast of South America, from Colombia in the north and through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina to the south. Here, the dense oceanic crust of the Nazca and Antarctic plates is subducting beneath the less-dense continental crust of the South American plate. The Andes are mostly being folded and uplifted from the thicker, less-dense rocks of the South American plate. The sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of the Andes are dotted by active and dormant volcanoes.\n• The Alps roughly mark the top of the 'boot' of the Italian Peninsula. The Alps stretch across Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Monaco, and France. Here, the tiny Adriatic plate is colliding with the much larger Eurasian plate to the north. The J-shaped Adriatic plate is a remnant of the African plate to the south, and today it carries the eastern Italian Peninsula as well as the entire Adriatic Sea. Alpine geology includes sedimentary and metamorphic rock, as well as igneous rocks that once were part of the ocean floor and were later uplifted in the process of folding.\n• Not all fold mountains are soaring peaks. The Appalachians, stretching along North America’s east coast, are generally low-lying, gentle slopes. Millions of years ago, the Appalachians were taller than the Himalayas! Millions of years of erosion, however, have taken their toll. Today, some of the highest peaks of the Appalachians are less than a third of the height of Everest.\n• The crust that is now the Appalachians began folding 480 million years ago, when the North American and African continental plates collided. Plate tectonics created this ancient mountain range, then called the Central Pangean Mountains . . . and plate tectonics tore it apart. As tectonic activity ripped apart the ancient supercontinent Pangea, the African, Eurasian, and North American plates drifted apart.\n• The Appalachians are just one remnant of the Central Pangean Mountains. The Appalachians stretch from the province of Newfoundland, in southeastern Canada, through the southern state of Alabama in the U.S. They are related to the gentle fold mountains of the Scottish Highlands (Eurasia) and the Little Atlas Mountains, Morocco (Africa)—their orogenic sisters from the Central Pangean Mountains.",,,
