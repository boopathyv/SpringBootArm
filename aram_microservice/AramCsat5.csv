,11,"Which of the following can be understood from the first paragraph of the passage? ",Common sense represents the knowledge on the nonexistent materials in the world. ,We hardly feel the hidden sociological notions naturally embedded to the common sense.,Common sense enables everyone to reckon and experience the phenomena of the world.,	People bound by commonsensical notion do not resist questions which would help them alter views.,b, "These facts may seem unquestionably simple and straightforward, but there is a deeper sociological value in them. It is often argued that sociological thinking is just a branch out of commonsense. People associate it with analysing the obvious and providing circular reasoning that never seem to have an empirical way of validation.","It is often argued that sociological thinking is just a branch out of commonsense. People associate it with analysing the obvious and providing circular reasoning that never seem to have an empirical way of validation. However, further comparison of the two can show the distinctions that can be illustrated by a simple reflection on our own lives. Everything around us exists in a commonsensical dimension - the size of clothes we're wearing, the brand of car we drive, or even the manner this essay is presented. It is commonsense that we choose the clothes that fit us whether we're an S or L size, we choose a certain type of car just because it allows us to be perceived in a certain way, and this essay is written in formal English and passed up on time because it contributes to our first year evaluation. These facts may seem unquestionably simple and straightforward, but there is a deeper sociological value in them. Who gets to decide which body shapes get to be a small size or a large size? Why do we feel much better driving a Mercedes than a Hyundai? What is so important about a degree? These are the questions sociological thought would implicate that commonsense would not able to.\nFirst, the difference of the two is that commonsense is a collective body of observed knowledge based on personal experiences, but sociological thinking is not. Nonetheless, it is understood that a part of sociological thought is derived from commonsense and everyday observation. As Berger once claimed,\n'To ask sociological questions, then, presupposes that one is interested in looking some distance beyond the commonly accepted or officially defined goals of human actions. It presupposes a certain awareness that human events have different levels of meaning, some of which are hidden from the consciousness of everyday life.'\nSociological thinking tries to view the society not as a group of isolated individuals or separate institutions, but as a whole . According to Brown, the society is an abstract concept that cannot be seen physically. It is a conceptual web of relations between people and the social institutions. While commonsense is extracted and slowly built up by practical knowledge of the everyday life, sociological thinking differs as it encourages thoughts and ideas that are levels higher than individuals' personal experiences; it sprouts thoughts on society as a whole.\nSecond, sociological thinking allows challenges to the presumed commonsense and urges a more radical and provoking approach to the social facts. According to Bauman and May, the relationship between commonsense and sociological thinking is a rather dependent one where sociological thinking is interpreting and investigating the meanings of social actions and facts that have been branded by commonsense. Commonsense has already labeled meanings and responses to most of the social facts that are collectively known by the members of society. The repitition of the actions become habitual, there are no more questionings for the meaning behind commonsense and they are somehow categorised as true and standing ways of life. \nBrown argues that the collection of the facts derived from collective comon sense are not equivalent to sociological thinking and research. It can only be fully understood with sociological theories which are formed with the sociological thought and imagination.\nThird, sociological thought can be categorised as scientific while commonsense cannot. Ananalytical comparison between commonsense and science by Nagel shows that science cannot be leveled with commonsense. In his rebuttal to Nagel's claim, Elliot strived to prove that commonsense is a part of science in the most basic ways, such as the conduct of experiment requires observation that is mainly an action that requires engagement and interpretation of the researcher himself. To further assert the claim, Emile Durkheim explored the positivist methodology in social science with his research on suicide. He thus affirms that sociology can be a science, alongside biology and psychology. Sociological thinking tries to view and analyse the social world from an objective standpoint while commonsense is a product of an individual's subjective experiences and therefore, the latter cannot be considered science.\nCommonsense is culturally angled knowledge that is subjectively varied between individuals and societies. However, sociological thinking attempts to postulate a higher level of consciousness and objectiveness to the macro social trends and happenings in relation to the society as a whole. C. Wright Mills once wrote, 'The sociological imagination enables its possessor to understand the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for the inner life and the external career of a variety of individuals.'So, with the points above, it can be concluded that sociological thinking is commonsense further evolved and probed to allow a greater understanding of society.\nCommon sense knowledge is based on beliefs, experiences and assumptions. Sociological knowledge is based on rigorous qualitative or quantitative research. Common sense reflects the generally accepted notions of a phenomenon and reinforces the status quo; whereas sociology, especially conflict theorists, challenge the status quo and argues for a change in the system. Common sense view is not reliable and valid, while the sociological view is highly reliable and valid\nSociology is criticized for being merely common sense and stating the obvious but in more detail than what we already know. Read and be informed...\nSociology and other social sciences focus on the study of certain aspects of human behavior. Yet human behavior is something with which we all have experience and about which we have at least a bit of knowledge. In our daily lives, we rely on common sense to get us through many unfamiliar situations. However, this knowledge while sometimes accurate is not always reliable because it rests on commonly held beliefs rather than systematic analysis of facts.\n Common sense is knowledge and awareness that is held communally (shared by majority of people). It does not depend on specialist education and in some respects states the obvious. Sociology is study of society and of people and their behavior. Positivists claim that it produces scientific knowledge.\nMany people argue that sociology merely state the obvious by reporting what common sense already tells us. In other words, sociology is criticized for being merely common sense and stating the obvious but in more detail than what we already know. Many sociologists have responded that common sense is wrong and obvious truths are not so obvious.\nCommon sense ideas and explanations represent a form of social perspective since they claim to represent the things that everyone knows about the social world and / or human behavior. These ideas are not necessarily incorrect but they seem to be different from sociological forms of knowledge.\nDurkheim led us to our first sociological understanding of the relationships between individuals and society, in that he contradicted common sense notions or perspectives.\nFrom common sense, we feel that society is made up of and controlled by individuals, whereas Durkheim showed us that individuals are products of society, and that society has various characteristics that go beyond the individual, and can not be explained by individual behaviour",,

The costs, in terms of well-being, physical health and productivity, are enormous. From twin studies, researchers know the inability to fall or stay asleep has a genetic component, but the identities of the culprits were mostly unknown.\nNow, the two studies published in Nature Genetics provide first peeks at the biological basis of insomnia, implicating specific brain regions and biological processes, and revealing links with heart disease and psychiatric disorders like depression. Both are genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which examine DNA from many thousands of individuals to determine where genetic markers related to health, disease or a particular trait reside. The first study, from a team led by geneticist Danielle Posthuma of Vrije University Amsterdam, analyzed the genomes of over 1.3 million people, making it the largest GWAS of any complex trait to date. They used data from the UK Biobank, a large, long-term genetics project, and from the direct-to-consumer genetics company 23andMe to identify 202 areas of the genome linked to insomnia, implicating 956 genes, a big advance from the seven found previously. 'I'm pretty confident the vast majority of these are real,' says geneticist Stephan Ripke, a GWAS expert at the Berlin Institute of Health who was not involved in either study. 'But we need to confirm this in more, separate cohorts from different countries and researchers.'\nThe researchers then investigated which brain regions and cells these genes frequently turn up in. This analysis implicated the axons (output connections) of neurons as well as parts of the cortex and deeper 'subcortical' brain regions like the striatum, involved in movement. It also tagged 'medium spiny neurons,' which occupy most of the striatum as well as neurons in other regions, including the hypothalamus. These findings tally with brain-imaging studies suggesting dysfunction of some regions in insomnia, and with animal studies implicating these cells in sleep regulation. 'Before our study we knew little about which genes, pathways and cells were involved,' Posthuma says. 'We now have concrete hypotheses that can be tested.' The second study, from a team led by geneticist Richa Saxena of Massachusetts General Hospital, interrogated over 450,000 genomes, again from the UK Biobank. They identified 57 regions, implicating 236 genes, and confirmed these results in analyses of two separate data sets. One of these used clinically diagnosed patients, a contrast to the other data compendium that was based on less reliable, self-reported symptoms. The team went further by analyzing data from nearly 84,000 UK Biobank participants who had worn motion detectors for a week to observe tossing and turning or sleepwalking, enabling them to link genetic findings with actual measures of sleep. 'This shows the findings are valid for different definitions of insomnia-related symptoms, including some that are measured objectively,' according to Virginia Commonwealth University statistical geneticist Mackenzie Lind.\nThe two studies found significant overlap between genes implicated in insomnia and those related to psychiatric and metabolic traits. Genes for traits, including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes were sometimes the same. The findings suggest insomnia is more strongly related to neuropsychiatric disorders than to other sleep-related traits such as whether someone is a morning person. 'That was a big surprise,' Saxena says. 'Implying that at the genetic level it's a disorder that's likely linked to psychiatric disease and mood regulation, and it's not necessarily just about sleep regulation.'\nBoth teams also used a technique (Mendelian randomization) that allowed them to infer what might be causing what by comparing their findings with GWAS results for other conditions. The two studies found insomnia may cause depression and coronary artery disease, and the larger study also found causal risk effects for BMI (body mass index) and type 2 diabetes. 'One of the motivations for using genetics to study sleep was to tease apart where it's causal where it's not,' Saxena says. 'So eventually interventions can be targeted to areas where things are causal.' Not all researchers are confident in these tests, however. 'The genetic overlap is sound,' Ripke says. 'But there's debate about these Mendelian randomization tests; I wouldn't take this for granted.'\nBoth studies implicated a gene involved in restless leg syndrome, which 'makes sense, given it's also a sleep disturbance,' Saxena says, although her team also found this may have been partly due to undiagnosed cases of RLS in their data sets. In fact, it is probable insomnia is not a singular condition but a cluster of symptoms grouped together, which can have a range of underlying causes. It could be a consequence of childhood trauma in one patient, due to disrupted circadian processes in another or just resulting from restless leg syndrome in another. 'If that's the case, then we'll really be able to dissect that with the genetics,' she says. 'Understanding if there are different types of insomnia, and how can we study them and maybe treat them separately, that's the hope for the whole field.'\nGoing forward, these findings provide entry points for researchers to dive into the biology of insomnia. 'We're following two strategies now,' Posthuma says. Implementation is proceeding by 'increasing sample size even further,' she notes, 'and setting up lab experiments to prove causation and show how implicated cell types influence insomnia.' Studies like this may illuminate new therapeutic targets. Although treatments exist, access to therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy cannot meet existing demand.\nThe behavioral therapy demonstrates, however, why this line of research is worth pursuing. The genetic overlap between insomnia and mood disorders may point toward why cognitive behavioral therapy may be effective for both sleep and anxiety. Current drugs, for their part, have limited efficacy, can be addictive and have side effects. 'Identifying new variants that contribute to risk helps pinpoint new biological targets,' Lind says. This search, she adds, is 'a step toward the eventual goal of using genetic information to predict risk and treatment outcomes, although we're not at this point yet.'",,

,11,"The tone of the passage can be best described as",Grieving,Chauvinistic,Commendatory,Challenging,d,The author challenges the dominant views. ,"The trend of women's entry in top echelons of management hides the seemingly insurmountable barriers that have been overcome by the protagonists in a male dominated society. Time has come when the bias against women will become a thing of the past. Progressive organizations have been doing their level best to give talented women managers their rightful place hierarchy. Still a lot needs to be done to shed the bias against women in Management. Problems seen in organizations are age-old.\nSome of them are: Women in organizations cannot act like women nor can they act like men. If they act like men, they are considered to be unfeminine. If they act feminine, they are considered to be weak. A very narrow bandwidth of acceptable behavior exists. They have to be lady-like and refrain from doing the things men do to gather power and control. Assertiveness and aggression is valued in men but not in women.\nFurther reinforcements of the Glass Ceiling: Glass Ceilings are reinforced by emphasizing the differences between the sexes and by playing gender-roles. Some of the ways in which this is done are attribution, presumed male ability and transactional analysis.\nWomen rarely get credit for what they do: It's always either a fluke or an accident, or somebody else did it and she took the credit. If a man gets promoted, It's because of ability. If a woman gets promoted, she slept her way to the top. In a classic experiment men and women were asked to evaluate the intelligence, persuasiveness and style of a set of essays. The subjects were told that the essays were written either by John T. consistently lower ratings from both men and women than John's.\nJust Like a Man: the ultimate compliment Most men think that the ultimate compliment that can be paid to a woman (in terms of her professionalism) is to call her a man. As Golda Meir\n(first lady PM of Israel) writes 'A story…… once went the rounds of Israel to the effect that Ben-Gurion (a senior figure) described me as the 'only man' in his cabinet. What amused me about it was that obviously he…… thought that this was the greatest possible compliment that could be paid to a woman. I very much doubt that any man would have been flattered if I had said about him that he was the only woman in the government'.\nThis kind of attitude assumes that in a man, ability is in-born but a woman has to work hard to acquire it. By virtue of gender, a man will be expected to have no trouble with a given task, while a woman will most probably fail. The Set-Up-To Fail syndrome that plagues a number of organizations usually begins with such assumptions.",,

",c," The statement is not clearly stated in the passage.","One of the most dramatic scientific adventures of this century is the exploration of space. We are not content to understand that it is infinite. We want landmarks, so to speak platforms for our satellites, or mathematical slots into which we can aim our space vehicles. We want to comprehend space; to define it; in a sense to use it. The other great cosmic reality is time. We may speculate about either end of our earthly existence. We may trust in immortality in the face of incomprehensible death; but, as in our efforts to define space, we must in our definition of time start where we are. All we can know is that man's average ration of time is three scores and ten years. What we do with our known allotment is what concerns us. Of most immediate concern is what we do with the smaller blocks of time within our grasp: the next week, the next day, the next hour, this very hour.\nWe all share a common belief that life is too short to be little. Yet the greatest frustration is that so much of life is just that. Perhaps more significant and dramatic than space exploration is an investigation of our use of time. 'What folly', said John Howe, 'to dread the thought of throwing away life at one, and yet have no regard to throwing it away by parcels and piecemeal.'\nAs with space, we are not content to comprehend time only as infinite. For many people the pressing questions is 'How am I going to manage my time?' Very busy people with many external demands do not have time on their hands. The next hour is very well programmed. This programming or structuring is what people try to achieve, and when they are unable to do it themselves, they look to others to structure time for them. 'Tell me what to do.' 'What shall I do next?' What we need is leadership.\nStructure hunger is an outgrowth of recognition bunger, which grew from the initial stroking hunger. The small child has not the necessary comprehension of time to structure it but simply sets about things which feel good, moment to moment. As he gets a little older he learns to postpone gratifications for greater rewards: 'I can go outside and make pies with Susie now, but if I wait twenty more minutes and keep my nice dress on, I can go to the shopping centre with Daddy.' This is basically a problem in structuring time. Which alternative will be more fun? Which will bring a greater reward? As we grow older we have more and more choices. However, the NOT OK position keeps us from exercising these choices as freely as we might think we do.\nIn our observation of transactions between people, we have been able to establish six types of experiences, which are inclusive of all transactions. They are withdrawal, rituals, activities pastimes, games and intimacy.\nWithdrawal although is not a transaction with another person, can take place, nonetheless, in a social setting. A man having lunch with a group of boring associates more concerned about their own stroking than his many withdraw into the fantasy of the night before when the stroking was good. His body is still at the lunch table, but he isn't. Schoolrooms on a nice spring day are filled with bodies whose occupants are down at the swimming on a nice spring day are filled with bodies whose occupants are down at the swimming the tree. Whenever people withdraw in such fashion it is always certain that the withdrawal keep them apart from those they are with bodily. This is fairly harmless unless it happens all the time, or unless your wife is talking to you.\nA ritual is a socially programmed use of time where everybody agrees to do the same thing. It is safe, there I no commitment to or involvement with another person, the outcome is predictable, and it can be pleasant in so far as you are in step or doing the right thing. There are worship rituals, greeting rituals, cocktail party rituals, bedroom rituals. The ritual is designed to get a group of people through the hour without having to get close to anyone. They may but they don't have to. It is more comfortable to go to a High Church Mass than to attend a revival service where one may be asked, 'Are you saved, brother?' Sexual relations are less awkward in the dark for people for whom physical intimacy has no involvement at the level of personality. There is less chance for involvement in throwing a cocktail party than in having a dinner for six. There is little commitment, therefore little fulfillment. Rituals, like withdrawal can keep us apart.\nAn activity, according to Bernce, is a common convenient, comfortable and utilitarian method of structuring time by a project designed to deal with the material of external reality. Common activities are keeping business appointments, doing the dishes, building a house, writing a book, shoveling snow, and studying for exams. These activities, in that they are productive or creative, may be highly satisfying. They may also lead to satisfactions in the future in the activity and there is no need for intimate involvement with another person. There may be, but there does not have to be. Some people use their work to avoid intimacy, working at night at the office instead of coming home, devoting their lives to making a million instead of making friends. Activities, like withdrawal and rituals, can keep us apart.",,

The rapid development of Internet and Computer technology world over has led to the growth of new forms of transnational crime related especially to the Internet. These crimes may affect any country across the globe as no geographic boundaries can stop them. Internet and computer based commerce and communications cut across territorial boundaries. Access to the internet allows linking up easily and cheaply with anyone.\nInternet is the fastest-growing communications medium in human history. It is not possible to quantify the size, use, and growth of the entire system. No one knows the exact number of people who use it, or the number of nodes on it. It is difficult even to know the amount of information that is transmitted through it. New forms of criminal activities in cyber space are coming to the forefront. Territorially based law-making and law-enforcing authorities find this new environment deeply threatening.\nThe World Wide Web was initially not thought of as needing any regulations. But over a period of time, it was found that the internet needed some rules and regulations to govern it, without which it can be used as a tool for the destruction of mankind. Unauthorized access to systems in order to steal users' passwords on the internet became a grave international concern. Law from the real world had to enter the realm of communications. So, a new discipline was developed in the U.S. about four years back called cyber law. Cyber law is a term, which denotes all aspects, issues and the legal consequences on the internet. Cyber crime refers to all the activities done with criminal intent in Cyberspace. Cyber Terrorism is a crime committed by individuals and groups to threaten governments and to terrorize citizens of a country by misusing Cyberspace. This is done by an individual or group when he succeeds in cracking into a government or military maintained web site.
