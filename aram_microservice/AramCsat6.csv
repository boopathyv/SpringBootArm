If I were a poet, I could write poetry on the possibilities of the five fingers. Why should you think that the mind is everything and the hands and feet nothing? Those who do not train their hands, who go through the ordinary rut of education, lack ‘music’ in their life. All their faculties are not trained. Mere book knowledge does not interest the child so as to hold his attention fully. The brain gets weary of mere words, and the child’s mind begins to wander. The hand does the things it ought not to do, the eye sees the things it ought not to see, the ear hears the things it ought not to hear, and they do not do, see, or hear, respectively, what they ought to. They are not taught to make the right choice and so their education often proves their ruin.

(The system does not resolve the vexatious issues).","It is time to examine the vexatious issue of inequalities through a different lens-view, namely of labour compensation and labour shares in national income. Policy considerations should focus on the tricky question of how to handle such inequalities and the government’s role in the same. Government regulations to protect the share of labour, as in India’s antiquated labour laws, would not work,leading either to greater unemployment (in the form of more contractual labour) or increased automation. A system of progressive taxation of capital would not work as well, leading only to greater tax evasion. On the one hand, we prescribe social nudges by the government in the form of tax breaks / rebates for firms which use variants of profit-sharing wage arrangements. These would not only help in reducing inequality, but also ensure better macroeconomic outcomes through generating regular private consumption and maintaining aggregate demand. On the other hand, government macropolicies may need to shift attention from growth and inflation towards employment and skill generation to mitigate the deleterious impact of globalization (especially financial globalization) and technical change on relative factor shares. Cash transfers, especially targeted at the rural wage earners may help in reducing the functional inequalities in India.",,

Inadequate budgetary resources for sanitation have affected both the quality and coverage of these services.

Nowadays, F D I plays a pivotal role in development of the economy as indicated by several studies (Alfaro, Chandra, KalemliOzcan, and Sayek (2004)). However, conversely there are empirical studies which indicate the FDI presence as inefficient . Implicitly, the impact of FDI on a country depends upon the nature of economy of the country. Our paper examines two giant developing nations – India and China, which have a high FDI flow. In this way, we analyze the determinants of FDI in India and China through econometric analysis. The reason for selecting India and China is, that these economies are primarily the most attractive destinations for FDI inflows in the whole world (UNCTAD Report, 2008). And according to the latest report of fDI intelligence (2014), China and India are amongst the top five destinations of foreign capital investment. We aim at identifying the best-suited model of capital inflows with special reference to FDI, affecting the growth of Chinese and Indian economies. In order to reach the best suited model, various models with different variables need to be examined and tested so as to determine when and where these are Determinants of FDI best suited in. FDI and FII are the two components of capital inflows in any country and these have become the drivers of international economic integration and stimulation. There are few fast growing economies like Singapore, China and Korea that have registered incredible growth due to the onset of FDI and FII.",,

While the most absorbing cricket match may last a day, elections can hold the attention of the society for almost two months. If one were to name any one characteristic of elections in India, it would be 'intensity' with a capital 'I'.

The concept of public accountability applies equally to all levels of government, its systems and sub -systems. To make these bodies publically responsible and accountable is an important aspect of public governance in modern times. The need of accountability stems from the ideal that the institutions of public governance are the repositories of public power and public power in turn is the trust or faith of the people. Therefore, public purpose requires, public interest needs and public good demands that exercise of public power must be subjected to the benefit of the society as a whole.

In view of this, the Kothari Commission endorsed the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission ","The Dhebar Commission of 1960 identified certain specified reasons for the educational backwardness of tribal's. They were vague generalisations like inappropriate and unattractive teaching methods adopted by the teachers, etc. It also touched other problems like poor economic condition and subsistence economy. In such a situation, children are seen as economic assets to supplement the family income by working with the parents and with others .In a situation of dire necessitates of life, education becomes a matter of luxury for the tribals .All these factors have contributed to work out a broader policy for tribal education. In this background, the Dhebar Commission made recommendations to provide the mid-day meal, clothing, free book, reading and writing materials, etc. to all the tribal children in backward areas. The commission further recognizing the topographical factors recommended the opening of schools in localities where there were at least 30 school-going children, though there should be a school within one mile. The commission then suggested adjustment of timing, vacations, and holidays of schools to suit the tribal social and cultural life. It even proposed to create an atmosphere of tribal culture in the schools. Similarly, the Kothari Commission has also highlighted that the tribals deserve education with great emphasis and attention. In view of this, the Kothari Commission endorsed the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission with a note of urgency that intensive efforts must be made to provide for five years of early education to all tribal children. In order to achieve the literacy rate among tribals, the Commission also suggested the need to educate parents simultaneously. The growth of tribal education was very slow due to high dropout rate and the growing gap between tribals and non-tribals. Due to this higher education among the tribals also suffered severely. The PESA(The Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 in fact, has made it mandatory for the States having scheduled areas to make specific provisions for giving wide-ranging powers to the tribes on the matters relating to decision-making and development of their community. A centrally-sponsored government scheme of ashram schools exclusively for Schedule Tribe children from elementary to higher secondary levels was initiated in the 1970s. But the poor quality of education in ashram schools, however, has undermined confidence in education as a vehicle for social mobility.",,

When a man of science tells us the result of experience, it also tells us how the experiment was performed. If other people can repeat it, it holds for real. In terms of religion, we must rely on the vision of a mystic who believed himself invested with a divine mission to assert something without real proof. According to Bertrand Russell, it is useless to talk to the mystic who claims to have experienced enlightenment and who has strong beliefs, but why should we force others to believe as well?\nA man of superior intelligence and logic as implacable as Bertrand Russell did not fail to bring out the incongruities and absurdities of a sacred text like the Bible.

To doubt the Bible, according to the Church was, to doubt the word of God and thus committing a sacrilege punishable by death.\nOne of the biggest conflicts between science and religion was unquestionably the position of the earth in the universe.
