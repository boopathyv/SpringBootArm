The enormous ecological resources of the sea have been exploited since ancient times and included the use of marine animals like fish and preparations from algae as the sources of medicine. Fish oils are the classic example of marine-derived product in use since ages. Marine pharmacology is a branch of pharmaceutical sciences which focuses on the substances with active pharmacological properties present in marine species of plants and animals. Marine environment is an exceptional store house of novel bioactive natural products, with structural and chemical features generally not found in terrestrial natural products. The marine organisms also provide a rich source of nutraceuticals and potential candidates for the treatment of several human diseases. The modern day focus of marine pharmacology is on microbes. This includes the discovery of new pharmaceutical candidates from marine microbes. The ocean provides enormous opportunities to discover new compounds as it has more than 13,000 molecules described out of which 3000 are having active properties. Marine natural products are generally secondary metabolites. They are not generated by biological or regular metabolic pathways and have no primary function associated with the development, growth, or propagation of a species.Sixty-three percentage of the new drugs are classified as naturally derived (i.e., modified natural product,unmodified natural product or synthetic compound with a natural product as pharmacophore).

'This black hole is growing so rapidly that it's shining thousands of times more brightly than an entire galaxy, due to all of the gases it sucks in daily that cause lots of friction and heat,' said Wolf. Researchers first unearthed the intergalactic beast after it was flagged by the ANU's SkyMapper telescope: a state-of-the-art gizmo tasked with creating a digital survey of over one billion stars and galaxies. They then used info from the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite to determine how far away it is.

Shashi Tharoor has famously remarked that India “paid for its own oppression” under British rule. India has exported cotton and fabrics to Europe since the 16th century — in the process procuring its own slavery and that of Africa.\nHarvard historian Sven Beckert writes in Empire of Cotton, 'What all these European trading companies had in common was that they purchased cotton textiles in India. whence they might be consumed domestically or shipped to Africa to pay for slaves to work the plantations just beginning to take root in the New World. Slaves, after all, could only be gotten by exchanging them for the cottons from India.'\nThe first truly Indian cotton mill is usually attributed to Cowasjee Nanabhai Davar of Bombay Spinning and Weaving Company. Built in Bombay in 1851, it started work in 1854. The very first cotton mills in India, however, were powered by the British. Bowreah Mills was built for £200,000, for 20,000 spindles and 100 looms, and was a pioneering attempt at imperial technology transfer to India.\nThe mill employed European women to teach machine-spinning skills to local workers. In the 1840s, the Mills was in a large complex that “included a cotton twist yarn factory, a rum distillery, a foundry, an oil mill, and a paper mill. There were five steam engines in the complex.” In the 1870s, it had grown to 45,000 spindles. By then, India had 47 mills in operation.",,

Now, let us think about what kind of numbers will have 16 factors..\nA number of the form p1<super>5</super> or q<super>3</super>r<super>3</super> will have exactly 16 factors. Both are perfect cubes. Note that there are other prime factorizations possible that can have exactly 16 factors.

This view helped to unify the artistic works created in the new style. The ancient Greeks had conceived of the world in concrete terms, even endowing abstract qualities with bodies. This Greek view of matter persisted, so far as painting was concerned, into the nineteenth century. The Impressionists, on the other hand, viewed light, not matter, as the ultimate visual reality.
